Below I have posted the written portions of my application to [*OpenCon 2015*](http://opencon2015.org/), which was called the [best conference ever](http://www.scopeofscience.com/2014/11/best-conference-ever/) by a 2014 attendee. This open science gathering will be held from November 14â€“16 in Brussels, Belgium. I have ordered my responses from practical to philosophical and mundane to radical.

### For the events you checked, please explain how you plan to participate.

Last year I went to the Bay Area Open Access Week [event](https://peerj.com/blog/post/97879213303/save-the-date-participative-bay-area-oa-week-event-for-generation-open/). Here I met the founder of [*Thinklab*](http://thinklab.com), the open science platform I now use for my research. I had not heard of [Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) until now but look forward to attending a local hackathon on its next occurrence.

### If you are currently engaged in activities to advance Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data, please describe them.

This year began with a major leap. I embarked on a fully open research project. First, I posted our [proposal](http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/proposal) on *Thinklab* -- a platform that pays scientists to interact openly. We constantly revise the proposal based on feedback. All research is [open notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science). And we post our analyses upon their conception.

The process has been a thrilling success. Currently [16 contributors](http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/leaderboard) have provided feedback and assistance, earning an estimated $1,136 US for their 59 comments. Our project has birthed [32 discussions](http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/discussion), each one a citable work with a dedicated DOI. I've made 350 public github [contributions](https://github.com/dhimmel) this year and published 23 project-related [repositories](https://github.com/dhimmel?tab=repositories).

I take pleasure in sifting through data, extracting insights, and providing condensed user-friendly derivations. To this end, I have created several websites: a [browser](http://het.io/disease-genes/browse/) for my results, a [download page](http://git.dhimmel.com/gene-ontology/) for sets of related genes, and an [analysis](http://git.dhimmel.com/SIDER2/) of side effects extracted from drug labels.

January 13<sup>th</sup> marked the culmination of an [independent study](https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705) coauthored with [my roommate](http://www.ksimeonov.com/). Using only publicly-available data, we identified an association between lung cancer and elevation in the American West. The study [spurred interest](https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/609054266645426176) in the topic and received lots of attention. It currently [ranks](https://www.altmetric.com/details/3060395#score) in the 99.9<sup>th</sup> percentile of articles tracked by Altmetric. *PeerJ's* [question feature](https://peerj.com/articles/705/#questions) and [my blog]({filename}../2015-01-15_cruk-reassessment/cruk-reassessment.md) served as post-publication venues for further investigation. The study cost no money and illustrates how open data facilitates citizen science.

While personally motivated by ideology, I know the move to openness must be driven by incentives. I hope to illustrate the benefits by example, but am also a hardened and vocal advocate. I am committed to [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) licensing for my work. And when training new scientists, open science is a large part of my [curricula](http://www.slideshare.net/himmelstein/biological-medical-informatics/36).

### What is your interest in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data and how does it relate to your work?

I predict new uses for existing drugs by mining the union of many diverse datasets. My project integrates over [20 public databases](http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/proposal#metanodes) and depends on open source tools.

Two consequences of open science attract me: hastening discovery and enabling anyone to be a scientist.

I yearn to see the reality behind [shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave). Alone this is impossible; I will always remain a prisoner. But together, through the crossbreeding of our works, we can escape the cave.

Newton's [quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants) from 1676 is no longer true. If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of dwarfs that *together* dwarf the giants.

### How would you use your experience at OpenCon to advance Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data?

Our weapons are immaterial -- crowdsourced knowledge, open source, the public domain, and technical standards -- yet nonetheless require a coordinated sharpening.

Central authority is antithetical to open science. The open scientist limits herself only by the bounds of possibility and heeds no artificial constraint. How then, without a ruler, does a decentralized community coordinate? Can an army of isolated heretics wage war on a unified front? The soldiers must be brought together.

*OpenCon 2015* is that gathering. With an assembly of 163, 13,203 peer-to-peer interactions are possible. And which interactions occur will determine the future of science.
