On January 24, 2010, Zeke Farwell completed the Long Trail.
He had begun just two days earlier, connecting more than 50 segments of trail spanning over 200 miles.
Motivated by "the longest and most well known hiking trail in Vermont", Zeke often revisited portions of the trails in the years to come.

Now I'm not revealing a secret [FKT](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/long-trail-vt "Fastest Known Time for the Long Trail"),
but rather the completion of the [Long Trail route](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/391736#map=8/43.888/-72.817) on OpenStreetMap.
OpenStreetMap is like Wikipedia but for maps: a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.

When I got in touch with Zeke, he wrote "I started contributing to OpenStreetMap in 2008 largely because good online trail maps were hard to come by at the time."
Due to the efforts of contributors like Zeke --- most volunteers, exceeding 6 million in number --- OpenStreetMap has begun to rival, and often exceed, proprietary alternatives like Google Maps.
I write this post to announce that **the best map of the Long Trail is now freely available to anyone via OpenStreetMap**.
Curious where the oldest long-distance hiking trail in America wanders?
Look no further than [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

## The Big Three

My interest in mapping the Long Trail began with my September 2020 southbound thru-hike.
As far as navigation options for hikers go, there are three main mapmakers:
Green Mountain Club, Guthook, and OpenStreetMap.

### Green Mountain Club

The [Green Mountain Club](https://www.greenmountainclub.org/) (GMC) is the non-profit organization that maintains the Long Trail.
The GMC publishes a [paper Long Trail map](https://store.greenmountainclub.org/collections/gmc-publications/products/new-5th-edition-vermonts-long-trail-map-waterproof), last updated in 2015 and on its 5th edition.
The map is plastic-coated for water resistance and divided into 8 sections to minimize refolding.
It includes distances, major side trails, shelter locations, 100-feet contour lines, hill-shading, elevation profiles, and nearby towns at 1:85,000 scale.
If you like a physical map, then consider supporting the GMC!
The map is listed at $12.95, and available from major retailers like [REI](https://www.rei.com/product/177869/green-mountain-club-vermonts-long-trail-map-5th-edition), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Green-Vermonts-Long-Trail/dp/1888021462/), and your local outfitters.

The GMC also releases a digital version of their map, [available](https://www.avenzamaps.com/maps/908930/long-trail-map) via the Avenza mobile App for $12.99.
With this map, you are essentially buying a georeferenced PDF of the paper map.
This means you can use your phone's GPS (which works in airplane mode) to superimpose your location on a static map.
But the PDFs are locked in the Avenza app, so make sure you like the Avenza interface before purchasing.

### Guthook Guides

https://atlasguides.com/long-trail/
$11.99 on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/guthook-guides-hike-offline/id605447532) for iOS or [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atlasguides.guthook) for Android

Best For: cheaters, trash talkers, trolls, influencers


### OpenStreetMap


Unlike the propreitary Google or Apple Maps, anyone is free to reuse OpenStreetMap




that make up America's oldest long-distance hiking trail as it wanders from Massachussettes to Canada along the spine of the Green Mountains in Vermont.



> Congrats on the thru-hike! I also hiked the LT in 2012. I’m having a hard time remembering exactly when I started working on the long trail in OSM, but I believe it was one of the earliest things I did. I started contributing to OSM in 2008 largely because good online trail maps were hard to come by at the time. I added trails in Vermont because that is where I live and like to hike. The Long Trail is the longest and most well known hiking trail in Vermont so it made sense to get that into OSM. I’m pretty sure I added it in my first year or two working on OSM. The ways making up the trail probably predate the relation because the idea of a relation data structure was either still very new to OSM or didn’t exist yet. If I remember correctly, I imported most of the trail from a publicly available government data source so it would have been “complete” from end to end right away. This imported trail was better than nothing, but not very accurate so for the next few years I refined it from my own GPS traces, aerial imagery, or any other data sources I came across. I haven’t payed too much attention in recent years, but I’m sure there are still plenty areas that need improvement. I did revisit the area around the Winooski River bridge after that was built and the trail rerouted in that area.

According to the US Forest service, the Long Trail is #1. But according to OSM, it's XXXXXX.
