On January 24, 2010, Zeke Farwell [completed](https://www.reddit.com/r/openstreetmap/comments/j6j5r5/when_was_the_long_trail_route_relation_first/ "Reddit OpenStreetMap: When was the Long Trail route relation first completed?") the Long Trail.
He had begun just two days earlier, connecting more than 50 segments of trail spanning over 200 miles.
Motivated by "the longest and most well known hiking trail in Vermont",
Zeke often revisited portions of the trails in the years to come.

Now I'm not revealing a secret [FKT](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/long-trail-vt "Fastest Known Time for the Long Trail"),
but rather the completion of the [Long Trail route](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/391736#map=8/43.888/-72.817 "OpenStreetMap relation for the Long Trail") on OpenStreetMap.
OpenStreetMap is like Wikipedia but for maps: a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.

When I got in touch with [Zeke](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/ezekielf), he wrote
"I started contributing to OpenStreetMap in 2008 largely because good online trail maps were hard to come by at the time."
Due to the efforts of contributors like Zeke — most volunteers, exceeding 6 million in number —
OpenStreetMap has begun to rival, and often exceed, proprietary alternatives like Google Maps.
I write this post to announce that **the best map of the Long Trail is now freely available to anyone via OpenStreetMap**.
Curious where the oldest long-distance hiking trail in America wanders?
Look no further than [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

## The Big Three

My interest in mapping the Long Trail began with my September 2020 southbound thru-hike.
As far as navigation options for hikers go, there are three main mapmakers:
Green Mountain Club, Guthook, and OpenStreetMap.

### Green Mountain Club

The [Green Mountain Club](https://www.greenmountainclub.org/) (GMC) is the non-profit organization that maintains the Long Trail.
The GMC publishes a [paper Long Trail map](https://store.greenmountainclub.org/collections/maps/products/preorder-now-long-trail-map-6th-edition-waterproof), last updated in 2021 and on its 6<sup>th</sup> edition.
The map is plastic-coated for water resistance and divided into 8 sections to minimize refolding.
It includes distances, major side trails, shelter locations, 100-feet contour lines, hill-shading, elevation profiles, and nearby towns at 1:85,000 scale.
If you like a physical map, then consider supporting the GMC!
The map is listed at $12.95, and available from major retailers like\
[REI](https://www.rei.com/product/177869/green-mountain-club-vermonts-long-trail-map-5th-edition "Outdated 5th edition"),
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Vermonts-Long-Trail-Green-Mountain/dp/1888021608/),
and your local outfitters.

The GMC also releases a digital version of their map, [available](https://www.avenzamaps.com/maps/1250308) via the Avenza mobile App for $12.99.
With this map, you are essentially buying a georeferenced PDF of the paper map.
This means you can use your phone's GPS (which works in airplane mode) to superimpose your location on a static map.
But the PDFs are locked in the Avenza app, so make sure you like the Avenza interface before purchasing.

### Guthook Guides

[Guthook Guides](https://atlasguides.com/) brands itself "the #1 app for long-distance hikes".
Currently, Guthook sells guides for 53 trails, including the [Long Trail](https://atlasguides.com/long-trail/) for the price of $11.99.
The Guthook App includes the route and locations of shelters, campsites, water sources, and viewpoints.
The real selling point however is the large number of user comments on points of interest (POIs).
The comments can help with scouting to optimize your hike,
but also can distract from the experience,
burn a hole in your battery pack,
and create reliance on an information source that isn't available for trails off the beaten path.

Guthook is made by hikers for hikers.
But its database of routes and POIs is proprietary.
Leaving a comment, or suggesting a new POI, on Guthook is sharing that information only with customers of Guthook,
rather than society at large.

-->

### OpenStreetMap

Unlike the proprietary Google or Apple Maps,
anyone is free to reuse and modify OpenStreetMap.
This has resulted in a diverse range of [contributors](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8050232 "Corporate Editors in the Evolving Landscape of OpenStreetMap") and [consumers](https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/about-osm-community/consumers/).
Tesla owners have added missing parking lots to improve their cars' _Smart Summon_ autonomous parking feature.
Amazon [updates](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/Amazon#searchInput) roadways and adds missing driveways to improve their delivery logistics.
The [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) applies the map to assist with disaster response. 
Popular navigation apps like Strava and MapMyRide show their users maps derived from OpenStreetMap.
I've even used it to [navigate](https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/1221841589661659138) through Africa.

OpenStreetMap has a lot more than just _streets_,
and contains natural features as well as those related to outdoor recreation,
such as trails, campsites, shelters, waterways, and cliffs.
Unlike the GMC and Guthook maps, OpenStreetMap is not based around any single trail.
Nonetheless, it [contains](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/391736#map=9/43.9839/-72.4919) the entire Long Trail.
But since OpenStreetMap itself is just a geospatial database,
it is best paired with an outdoor navigation focused app that specialize in rendering wilderness.

-->
The website [Waymarked Trails](https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/#route?id=391736&map=9!43.8387!-72.55740 "Waymarked Trails centered on the Long Trail") allows you download the trail as GPX or KML,
such that you could load it into your favorite navigation app —
popular ones include
[Strava](https://www.strava.com/routes/2844248654783965478),
[Gaia GPS](https://www.gaiagps.com/datasummary/track/51e2332d-0399-41d5-9e23-968916faf05c/),
[CalTopo](https://caltopo.com/m/TFDH),
[AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/map-68897f1--47),
[ViewRanger](https://my.viewranger.com/route/details/NDAxMzk1Nw==),
[Outdooractive](https://www.outdooractive.com/en/route/hiking-route/the-long-trail-from-openstreetmap/214594603/),
and [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/tour/403656220).
All of these apps include data from OpenStreetMap in their default map rendering.
So by exporting the Long Trail to a route and uploading it to these apps,
we're essentially highlighting a trail that should already be on the map.
Many of these apps support downloading maps for offline, but sometimes only as a paid feature.

If you just want to look at the map quickly,
here's an embedded map [from uMap](https://u.osmfr.org/m/506490/) of the Long Trail:

</iframe>

### Comparison

Here's how the three maps look on mobile.
With both GMC/Avenza and Guthook,
you're required to use their selected map as the background.
If you look closely at the Guthook screenshot,
you'll see the map is from Google.
For an OpenStreetMap-derived map,
we can use any of the options above.
Here, Gaia GPS is used with their dark mode map.

![The big three Long Trail maps side-by-side: GMC via Avenza, Guthook Guides, and OpenStreetMap via Gaia GPS.]({attach}long-trail-maps-side-by-side.png)

I picked a landmark segment of the trail,
which passes over the Winooski River and under Interstate 89,
coinciding with the lowest elevation point along the hike.
One difference between the maps is that Guthook skips a part of the trail,
staying on Duxbury Road instead.
If you look at the comments on Guthook for the nearby trailhead,
many users note the new-and-true route.
This is a good example of how Guthook comments provide advanced reconnaissance,
but can diminish the experience should they spoil the surprise of a guard dog ambush or tempt you to [yellow blaze](https://adventurepossible.com/adventure/white-blue-and-other-blazes-of-the-appalachian-trail/).


## My Hike

I hiked the Long Trail in September, with my two friends Freshmeat and I.A.O. Moosalamoo (trail names).
September is an ideal month, since there's fewer bugs, less mud, and later sunrises.
But really any month is a good time to hike!
We hiked 280 miles over 12 days, 22 hours, and 42 minutes,
<!-- 310:42:45 according to ViewRanger recording -->
taking us from Canada to Massachusetts along the spine of the Green Mountains.

It's hard to sum up the trip in three photos.
But I'll try.

The trail hits many of Vermont's most prominent ski areas,
including
Stratton (detour),
Bromley,
Killington (recommended detour),
Pico (detour),
Middlebury Snow bowl,
Sugarbush,
Mad River Glen,
Stowe,
Smuggler's Notch,
and Jay Peak.
Here Freshmeat enjoys the morning fog on Lift 2 of Mad River Glen:

![Sitting on the top chair of Lift 2 at Mad River Glen in the Fog.]({attach}2020-09-18_ski-lift-in-the-fog.jpg)

Big ponds carefully crafted by beavers:

![Dead tree in front of beaver pond with reflections in the morning.]({attach}2020-09-25_beaver-pond.jpg)

A feast for all after a grueling day that started in Johnson and ended at the Taft Lodge on Mount Mansfield.
We were rewarded by an unremarkable, windy, and solitary sunrise the next morning on Vermont's highest peak.

## Editing the Map

According to the US Forest Service, the Long Trail is #1 (or perhaps #3).
But according to OpenStreetMap, it's 391736.
That is the ID for the [Long Trail *relation*](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/391736#map=9/43.8137/-72.9231).
The relation connects all the individual trail segments (called ways) into a single conceptual unit.

When I mentioned Zeke Farwell completing the Long Trail, I was referring to the relation which created a continuous path the length of Vermont.
Zeke described a bit more about his early work on the Long Trail:

> I imported most of the trail from a publicly available government data source so it would have been “complete” from end to end right away.
This imported trail was better than nothing,
but not very accurate so for the next few years I refined it from my own GPS traces, aerial imagery, or any other data sources I came across.

He went on to complete the trail physically in 2012.
Eight years later, when I hiked the trail with a copy of the OpenStreetMap relation loaded into my navigation gap,
I noticed some portions of the trail were off.
And many side trails were missing.
Many of the trails still followed Zeke's original imports,
and hadn't yet benefitted from a decade of increased data and improved GPS accuracy.

So I set out to revise the entire Long Trail.
Over a third of the Long Trail is shared with the Appalachian Trail.
I expected the Appalachian Trail portion to be more accurate due to its significance,
but this was not the case.

I based my mapping primarily on GPS tracks.
First I had my own track from our thru-hike and second I could reference the [Strava heatmap](https://www.strava.com/heatmap),
which summarizes all tracks from the past two years.

I used the online iD editor for all of my edits (except for rearranging the relation members which I had to do with JOSM).
Here is an in-progress edit of the summit of Stratton Mountain.
The dashed lines show the trails in OpenStreetMap.
The red/orange/yellow heatmap shows the tracks of Strava users.
The pink line is my track.

![2020-09-29_osm-iD-editor-stratton-mountain]({attach}2020-09-29_osm-iD-editor-stratton-mountain.png "Editing OpenStreetMap on 2020-09-29 using the iD editor with a Strava Heatmap background. The red line shows the track of our hike. GPS tracks indicate the Long Trail is incorrectly placed.")

Any GPS recording from consumer hardware will have some inaccuracy, but this is easily overcome by averaging many tracks!
Wisdom of the crowd.
My track as well as the Strava heatmap make it clear that the Long Trail needs to be shifted East, along with some other alignments.
I made these changes in [changeset 91733004](https://overpass-api.de/achavi/?changeset=91733004),
where I also added additional metadata to the fire tower like that its height is 21 meters.
Maybe now the tower will [show up](https://www.engadget.com/flight-simulator-open-street-map-building-205545509.html "A typo created a 212-story monolith in ‘Microsoft Flight Simulator’") in flight simulators.
By the way, if you like fire towers, the Long Trail has three:
[Glastenbury](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5129580921),
[Stratton](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/356555377) (enclosed),
and [Belvidere](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/618994751).

In total, I made [34 changesets](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dhimmel/osm-get-user-changeset-metadata/blob/dhimmel-changesets/long_trail_changesets.ipynb) (collections of edits) related to the Long Trail.
I started the edits the day after getting back from the hike,
and completed my revisions in 11 days, faster even than we hiked it!
Warning before you start contributing to OpenStreetMaps,
it can be addicting.

On the interactive map above, there is a _before_ layer you can toggle on, which will show the Long Trail route before my edits.
While only a few sections deviated in major ways, I realigned large portions of the trial.
Looking at features (specifically nodes, ways, and relations) that were [last edited by me](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/18VX),
you'll notice a pattern in my contributions spanning the Long Trail (along with the Upper Valley, see also [YOSMHM](https://yosmhm.neis-one.org/?zoom=9&lat=43.89078&lon=-71.98882&layers=B00TTF&u=dhimmel)):

![OpenStreetMap points and ways edited most recently by dhimmel.]({attach}2021-06-28_dhimmel-osm-edits.png)

Do you see the section in the middle of the trail (Green Mountain National Forest) where I don't have any of the most recent edits?
That is because another user [Adam Franco](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Adam%20Franco) made [further enhancements](https://overpass-api.de/achavi/?changeset=103664322) more recently.
That is the beauty of OpenStreetMap.
It is a living map,
whose model of open licensing and crowdsourced contribution give rise to a map more complete and encompassing than any proprietary alternative.

Liberate the trails, put them on the map!

Message from Zeke: https://www.openstreetmap.org/messages/894718

> Congrats on the thru-hike! I also hiked the LT in 2012. I’m having a hard time remembering exactly when I started working on the long trail in OSM, but I believe it was one of the earliest things I did. I started contributing to OSM in 2008 largely because good online trail maps were hard to come by at the time. I added trails in Vermont because that is where I live and like to hike. The Long Trail is the longest and most well known hiking trail in Vermont so it made sense to get that into OSM. I’m pretty sure I added it in my first year or two working on OSM. The ways making up the trail probably predate the relation because the idea of a relation data structure was either still very new to OSM or didn’t exist yet. If I remember correctly, I imported most of the trail from a publicly available government data source so it would have been “complete” from end to end right away. This imported trail was better than nothing, but not very accurate so for the next few years I refined it from my own GPS traces, aerial imagery, or any other data sources I came across. I haven’t payed too much attention in recent years, but I’m sure there are still plenty areas that need improvement. I did revisit the area around the Winooski River bridge after that was built and the trail rerouted in that area.

## External Route title and description

The Long Trail from OpenStreetMap

The Long Trail is the world's first long distance hiking trail and runs from Massachusetts to Canada along the spine of the Green Mountains in Vermont.

This route was posted as a companion to the blog post https://blog.dhimmel.com/long-trail-maps/. The route was extracted from OpenStreetMap on 2021-06-27 using Waymarked Trails:
