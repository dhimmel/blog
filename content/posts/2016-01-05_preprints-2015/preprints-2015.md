2015 was a year of the preprint. While posting manuscripts prior to peer review and journal publication [has](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.2700v2.pdf) long been practiced in physics, preprints are just catching on in the biosciences.

Last year, labs [started](https://medium.com/@greenescientist/why-we-preprint-fb3bfbcdf4ff "Why we preprint") universally preprinting, and preprints [were billed](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1511912112 "Accelerating scientific publication in biology") as the solution to accelerating an ever more laborious publishing process.

To give some context, *PeerJ PrePrints* and *bioRxiv* both launched in 2013. Prior to 2015, *PeerJ* published [on average](https://gist.github.com/dhimmel/81f55d62af27197a845e "Growth of bioscience preprints in 2015") 1.2 preprints per day compared to 2.4 for *bioRxiv*. Yet in 2015, *PeerJ* averaged 2.3 per day while _bioRxiv_ averaged 4.9. Since together *bioRxiv* and *PeerJ* published only 2,626 preprints in 2015 while PubMed grew by 1,082,213 articles, the ~100% annual growth in preprinting could persist for the next several years.

And the [incentives](https://peerj.com/blog/post/115284878288/a-peerj-preprint-so-just-what-is-that-exactly/ "A PeerJ PrePrint – so just what is that exactly?") for preprinting will likely spur continued growth. In short, the benefits—establishing precedent and increased article lifespan—outweigh the disadvantages—ineligibility to a [dwindling set](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/browse.php?colour=white&la=en&fIDnum=|&mode=simple "SHERPA/RoMEO List of white publishers") of démodé journals. While preprint servers may not provide the same visibility as journal, they can still be influential. For example, my first preprint [was featured](http://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook#/2/2 "Data Biologist Cookbook: Unlocking the Genetics of Complex Diseases") in a review, and my second [drove interest](http://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook#/2/1 "Data Biologist Cookbook: Oxygen driven tumorigenesis") in the topic.

One final drawback is the [Google Scholar bug](http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/11/1/the-google-scholar-preprint-bug/ "The Google Scholar preprint bug"), where the existence of a preprint prevents subsequent journal publication from appearing in the Google Scholar database. Despite [discouraging](http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/12/2/how-google-scholar-discourages-young-scientists-from-posting-preprints/ "How Google Scholar discourages young scientists from posting preprints") openness and [frequently occurring](http://serialmentor.com/blog/2015/10/8/Google-Scholar-bug-redux/ "The Google Scholar preprint bug redux"), the bug is [considered a "feature"](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/05/guest-post-highwires-john-sack-on-online-indexing-of-scholarly-publications-part-1-what-we-all-have-accomplished/#comment-155918 "Post by Anurag Acharya on the Scholarly Kitchen") by Scholar's creator, so don't expect a resolution anytime soon.

The cruel twist is the longer the publishing delay, the [greater the chance](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/05/guest-post-highwires-john-sack-on-online-indexing-of-scholarly-publications-part-1-what-we-all-have-accomplished/#comment-155925 "Post by Anurag Acharya on the Scholarly Kitchen") of triggering the Scholar preprint bug. For example, my first study on hetnets experienced a delay of 105 days from acceptance to [publication](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259 "Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes") on July 9<sup>th</sup>. Now, 179 days later, Google Scholar still only indexes the *bioRxiv* preprint. Double whammy!

While preprints are a workaround for excessive publication delays, their current incarnations are limited. There has been little preprint innovation since [1997](https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/677899029976473600 "Tweet: Little innovation in preprint servers since 1997"). _bioRxiv_ and _PeerJ_ preprints are still PDF only, with no web display, although _PeerJ_ appears to be aware of this problem given their creation of [paper-now](https://github.com/PeerJ/paper-now "Create, edit and display a journal article, entirely in GitHub"), a GitHub Pages solution to publishing.

Preprints bring us closer to open science, which has been [defined as](https://youtu.be/LwW1-X3glak "Open research video"):

> scientists sharing their research with the world as soon as they record it for themselves.

Preprints help counteract publishing delays, which are by definition anti-open. However, preprints are not a panacea! Withholding publication until a study is complete is a major obstacle towards greater scientific efficiency.

Feedback is most helpful early on, when mistakes are still rectifiable. And scientific outputs are often must useful when young, while still state of the art. Platforms such as [*Thinklab*](http://thinklab.com/ "A community for real-time open collaborative science"), [*RIO*](http://riojournal.com/ "Research Ideas and Outcomes"), and [GitHub](https://github.com "GitHub") now allow collaborative open science from a project's conception.

As an example, I'm performing my [current project](https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4 "Repurposing drugs on a heterogeneous network") using *Thinklab*. In the last year, 22 community [participants](http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/leaderboard "Project leaderboard on Thinklab") contributed feedback across 57 [discussions](http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/discussion "Project discussions on Thinklab"). We've created lots of valuable content that's been accruing views, citations, and page rank—none of which would exist had we withheld sharing until completing a preprint.

So while I wholeheartedly recommend preprinting, I encourage those interested in major scientific disruption to look further.

In closing, here are three recommendations for maximizing the potential of your science with preprints:

1. Release your preprint under a [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ "Creative Commons — Attribution 4.0 International") license to encourage reuse and hence citation.
2. Treat your preprint as a publication: all data and code needed to reproduce the study should be available and appropriately licensed.
3. Make sure to update your preprint with revisions. Help readers stay up to date while gaining visibility on the recents list.
