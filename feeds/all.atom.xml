While posting manuscripts prior to peer review and journal publication &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.2700v2.pdf"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; long been practiced in physics, preprints are just catching on in the&amp;nbsp;biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, labs &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@greenescientist/why-we-preprint-fb3bfbcdf4ff"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; universally preprinting, and preprints &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1511912112"&gt;were billed&lt;/a&gt; as the solution to accelerating an ever more laborious publishing&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give some context, &lt;em&gt;PeerJ PrePrints&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; both launched in 2013. Prior to 2015, &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/dhimmel/81f55d62af27197a845e"&gt;on average&lt;/a&gt; 1.2 preprints per day compared to 2.4 for &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;. Yet in 2015, &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; averaged 2.3 per day while &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; averaged 4.9. Since together &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; published only 2,626 preprints in 2015 while PubMed grew by 1,082,213 articles, the ~100% annual growth in preprinting could persist for the next several&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/blog/post/115284878288/a-peerj-preprint-so-just-what-is-that-exactly/"&gt;incentives&lt;/a&gt; for preprinting will likely spur continued growth. In short, the benefits—establishing precedent and increased article lifespan—outwiegh the disadvantages—ineligibility to a &lt;a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/browse.php?colour=white&amp;amp;la=en&amp;amp;fIDnum=|&amp;amp;mode=simple"&gt;dwindling set&lt;/a&gt; of démodé journals. While preprint servers may not provide the same visibility as journal, they can still be influential. For example, my first preprint &lt;a href="http://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook#/2/2"&gt;was featured&lt;/a&gt; in a review, and my second &lt;a href="http://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook#/2/1"&gt;drove interest&lt;/a&gt; in the&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final drawback is the &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/11/1/the-google-scholar-preprint-bug/"&gt;Google Scholar bug&lt;/a&gt;, where the existence of a preprint prevents subsequent journal publication from appearing in the Google Scholar database. Despite &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/12/2/how-google-scholar-discourages-young-scientists-from-posting-preprints/"&gt;discouraging&lt;/a&gt; openness and &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2015/10/8/Google-Scholar-bug-redux/"&gt;frequently occurring&lt;/a&gt;, the bug is &lt;a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/05/guest-post-highwires-john-sack-on-online-indexing-of-scholarly-publications-part-1-what-we-all-have-accomplished/#comment-155918"&gt;considered a &amp;#8220;feature&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by Scholar&amp;#8217;s creator, so don&amp;#8217;t expect a resolution anytime&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cruel twist is the longer the publishing delay, the &lt;a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/05/guest-post-highwires-john-sack-on-online-indexing-of-scholarly-publications-part-1-what-we-all-have-accomplished/#comment-155925"&gt;greater the chance&lt;/a&gt; of triggering the Scholar preprint bug. For example, my first study on hetnets experienced a delay of 105 days from acceptance to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259"&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt; on July 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Now, 179 days later, Google Scholar still only indexes the &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprint. Double&amp;nbsp;whammy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While preprints are a workaround for excessive publication delays, their current incarnations are limited. There has been little preprint innovation since &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/677899029976473600"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; preprints are still &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; only, with no web display, although &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; appears to be aware of this problem given their creation of &lt;a href="https://github.com/PeerJ/paper-now"&gt;paper-now&lt;/a&gt;, a GitHub Pages solution to&amp;nbsp;publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints bring us closer to open science, which has been &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LwW1-X3glak"&gt;defined as&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scientists sharing their research with the world as soon as they record it for&amp;nbsp;themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints help counteract publishing delays, which are by definition anti-open. However, preprints are not a panacea! Withholding publication until a study is complete is a major obstacle towards greater scientific&amp;nbsp;efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is most helpful early on, when mistakes are still rectifiable. And scientific outputs are often must useful when young, while still state of the art. Platforms such as &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://riojournal.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; now allow collaborative open science from a project&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, I&amp;#8217;m performing my &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4"&gt;current project&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;. In the last year, 22 community &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/leaderboard"&gt;participants&lt;/a&gt; contributed feedback across 57 &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/discussion"&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;ve created lots of valuable content that&amp;#8217;s been accruing views, citations, and page rank—none of which would exist had we withheld sharing until completing a&amp;nbsp;preprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I wholeheartedly recommend preprinting, I encourage those interested in major scientific disruption to look&amp;nbsp;further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, here are three recommendations for maximizing the potential of your science with&amp;nbsp;preprints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release your preprint under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; license to encourage reuse and hence&amp;nbsp;citation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat your preprint as a publication: all data and code needed to reproduce the study should be available and appropriately&amp;nbsp;licensed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to update your preprint with revisions. Help readers stay up to date while gaining visibility on the recents&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/li&gt;

EMPs are short bursts of energy that can fry electronics. Large scale EMPs can be triggered by solar flares or high altitude nuclear detonations. A hefty nuclear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; could destroy unprotected electronic equipment within a thousand miles radius. The podcast motivated me recount my strange story involving EMPs and slime&amp;nbsp;molds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arguing the&amp;nbsp;unforeseen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year was 2010. I was a junior at Cornell, where I was on the debate team. In policy debate, there is a single topic for the entire year. And this year the topic was nuclear weapons. The season was in full swing. My partner and I were preparing for the National Debate Tournament&amp;nbsp;qualifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had qualified our sophomore year, but only by the skin of our teeth. We needed a single ballot in the final round of the qualifiers, but were paired against a seemingly invincible opponent from Harvard. After the debate, expecting defeat, we nervously waited for the last judge to cast his ballot. Minutes turned to hours. Finally, the judge marked his vote, folded the ballot, and handed it to an elderset guru of the activity to&amp;nbsp;announce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did it! I jumped up to embrace my partner and accidentally kneed him in the&amp;nbsp;balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to repeat the suspense, we were preparing vigorously for this year&amp;#8217;s qualifier. To catch the opponents off guard, we had to prepare a novel proposal — one that had not been debated by any of the thousands of teams nationwide that&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon the topic of nuclear EMPs. Information was scant. Whether the major superpowers even considered high altitude detonation in their nuclear planning was poorly documented. My sources were fringe. I even had to order a &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/0964764369"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; because no university libraries carried it. Nevertheless, we pieced together a proposal to ban high altitude nuclear explosions to reduce the likelihood of debilitating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing your own arguments is not essential for debate. But picking winning arguments is. Policy debate assumes an environment of natural selection: throughout a season, the arguments that survive are likely the most&amp;nbsp;veracious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, in the midst of sensationalism designed to outweigh the opponent&amp;#8217;s criticism, I sensed a certain truth to our argument. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; threat is real and our society is ill-prepared. Ironically, we lost the one and only debate where we deployed this&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, finally posting the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1487717"&gt;130 page compilation&lt;/a&gt; of evidence we compiled for a single loss will provide some&amp;nbsp;closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meanwhile in the land of&amp;nbsp;slime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same semester, I came across a study on slime mold, presumably via &lt;a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/10/01/22/1715229/slime-mold-could-lead-to-better-tech"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; because I didn&amp;#8217;t have Twitter yet. The &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1177894"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; used a slime mold species, &lt;em&gt;Physarum polycephalum&lt;/em&gt;, to create a blueprint of Tokyo&amp;#8217;s railway&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slime mold was unlike any life form I had seen. In its vegetative state, called a plasmodium, the slime mold forms a gigantic single cell containing many nuclei. It moves by pulsating, generally in search of its preferred food source, &lt;a href="http://www.quakeroats.com/"&gt;Quaker Oats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="videoWrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe width="604" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lls27hu03yw?start=10&amp;feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=light&amp;showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reconstruct the Tokyo railway, researchers placed Quaker Oats in a petri dish corresponding to population centers. Since slime mold detests light, the researchers illuminated areas corresponding to geographic no-nos such as lakes and mountains. Originating downtown, the slime mold initially expanded throughout the petri dish. Then the slime mold retracted to form a tubular network connecting the food sources. When analyzed for efficiency, cost, and fault tolerance, these networks were often comparable or superior to the real&amp;nbsp;deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The slime and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;converge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, my junior spring, I took the best course of my Cornell experience, &lt;a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info2040_2010sp/"&gt;networks&lt;/a&gt;. The final paper asked for an &amp;#8220;exploration of a topic related to the course.&amp;#8221; I &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1488841"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; using slime mold networks to reconstruct the power grid after an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; attack. Food sources would represent power plants. Slime mold would be tasked with reconnecting the power grid, but constrained by a light gradient representing the&amp;nbsp;blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://wl.figshare.com/articles/1488841/embed?show_title=0" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; had a short lived debate appearance, it did help me get an &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; in&amp;nbsp;class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The slime still&amp;nbsp;slithers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second year of my PhD at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt;, I was required to present at a journal club. A &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215037109"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using the same species of slime mold as before caught my interest. The study found that the plasmodium deposits a slime trail, which it exploits for spacial memory. In other words, when foraging for Quaker Oats, the slime mold preferentially explores untrotted areas. The &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/himmelstein/slime-mold-short"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; from my presentation are&amp;nbsp;below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me celebrate the completion of this blog post with a bottle of Avery&amp;#8217;s Toxic Slime electric blue &lt;a href="http://www.averysoda.com/TotallyGrossSoda.html"&gt;soda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="EMP"></category><category term="electromagnetic pulse"></category><category term="slime mold"></category><category term="debate"></category><category term="Cornell HK"></category><category term="nuclear weapons"></category><category term="Cornell"></category></entry><entry><title>Publication delays at PLOS and 3,475 other journals</title><link href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/plos-and-publishing-delays/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-29T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Himmelstein</name></author><id>tag:blog.dhimmel.com,2015-06-29:plos-and-publishing-delays/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On April 22, 2015 my research was formally accepted to &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;. 68 days later the article has yet to be published. My &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4"&gt;current project&lt;/a&gt; builds on the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/011569"&gt;forthcoming study&lt;/a&gt; and would benefit from its publication. Frustrated, I decided to investigate whether such delays are commonplace at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publication and acceptance delays at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by retrieving all PubMed records for the 7 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals. For each journal, I randomly selected 1000 articles and scraped the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; website for receival, acceptance, and publication timestamps. Using this scraped data, I plotted publishing delays over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PLOS publication times from website scraping" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/scraped-plos-publication-times.png" title="Scraped PLOS publication times" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not alone! Starting in 2011, publications delays at &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; began regularly breaching 80 days. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt; experienced similar publishing delay explosions in 2011, although appear to have recently improved. These extreme temporal fluctuations suggest that delays are not an innate and immutable characteristic of publishing, but instead dependent on operational efficiency and organizational&amp;nbsp;well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two oldest and most established &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals, &lt;em&gt;Biology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, followed a different pattern: long delays in their early years followed by stability at 40 days since 2009. The dearth of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Biology&lt;/em&gt; records prior to 2009, resulted from broken &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOI&lt;/span&gt; redirects. Before my scraper finished its duties, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/613842560360951808"&gt;fixed the issue&lt;/a&gt; resulting in the few visible &lt;em&gt;Biology&lt;/em&gt; articles of that&amp;nbsp;period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scraped data is nice because it comes directly from the source, but is time intensive and limited to a single webpage layout. Therefore, I also extracted timestamps from PubMed. Below I show publication (solid lines) and acceptance (dotted lines) times from this larger&amp;nbsp;dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PLOS acceptance and publication times from PubMed" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/plos-stages.png" title="PLOS acceptance times (dotted line) and publication times (solid line)" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more articles, fine-grained temporal trends emerge. The findings are consistent with the scraped data. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; appears to have made some recent improvement, but still is over 50 days from acceptance to&amp;nbsp;publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding acceptance time, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Medicine&lt;/em&gt; is an outlier, teetering around the 200 day mark. This finding is in line with my single experience with &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which consisted of poor communication and&amp;nbsp;delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt; has historically fared well compared to other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals both in acceptance and publication times. However, delays at &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt; have been relentlessly trending upwards. The focus on technical validity rather than article impact at &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt; likely contributes to quicker review and revision&amp;nbsp;periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publication and acceptance delays for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I decided to compile recent delay information for as many journals as possible. I instructed my PubMed querier to retrieve records for all 1,572,538 publications since 2014. Of these articles, 667,773 had timestamps. PubMed data is not perfect. For example, 9,945 articles had anachronistic timestamps and were&amp;nbsp;omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at delays for open access journals in my field. Below, publication time distributions are shown for 16&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Publishing time per journal" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/publication-days-violinplot.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; has the highest median publication time. Since all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals use the same editorial and typesetting system, the poor performance across the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; family is&amp;nbsp;unsurprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; is quickest with a majority of articles published within 3 days after acceptance. The comparison is skewed because &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; allows &lt;a href="http://elifesciences.org/content/early/recent"&gt;early access&lt;/a&gt; to a pre-formatted article &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;. However, early access provides many of the benefits of publication such as visibility and&amp;nbsp;citability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I looked at acceptance times for the same 16&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Acceptance time per journal" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/acceptance-days-violinplot.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; is a clear winner with a median time of 74 days. The variation between journals for acceptance time is less drastic than for publication time: peer review sets a lower limit on the time needed for&amp;nbsp;acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publication and acceptance times for all&amp;nbsp;journals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the median days till acceptance and publication for 3,482 journals. A journal may be omitted if it is not indexed by PubMed or had no timestamped articles since&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id="journals" class="display" cellspacing="0" width="100%"&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Calling for a journal review&amp;nbsp;service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptance and publication times are not the only factor to consider when selecting a journal. Traditionally, the impact factor &amp;#8212; average citations for articles published in the two preceding years &amp;#8212; has been a primary criteria. However, any single metric is insufficient to make an informed decision on where to submit. A host of other journal attributes matter such as readership, aesthetics, communication, friendliness, flexibility, features, and web&amp;nbsp;nativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose a journal review service. Like yelp for scientific publishing except that author reviews will be &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I see three main&amp;nbsp;benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency &amp;#8212; past author experiences with a journal are a treasure trove in need of a display&amp;nbsp;case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search &amp;#8212; even finding all journals that publish research in your field is difficult. A search feature would support filters and rankings based on user&amp;nbsp;preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progress &amp;#8212; journals can improve based on their feedback. If not, they will&amp;nbsp;perish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know in the comments if any services already exist to fulfill this&amp;nbsp;role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In&amp;nbsp;conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal in performing this extensive evaluation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; publishing times was to bring light to an area of publishing that needed it. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; led the open access revolution and still has its unique advantages. Hopefully, public feedback will allow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; to improve in the areas where it&amp;nbsp;struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

This open science gathering will be held from November 14–16 in Brussels, Belgium. I have ordered my responses from practical to philosophical and mundane to&amp;nbsp;radical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;For the events you checked, please explain how you plan to&amp;nbsp;participate.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I went to the Bay Area Open Access Week &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/blog/post/97879213303/save-the-date-participative-bay-area-oa-week-event-for-generation-open/"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;. Here I met the founder of &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the open science platform I now use for my research. I had not heard of &lt;a href="http://opendataday.org/"&gt;Open Data Day&lt;/a&gt; until now but look forward to attending a local hackathon on its next&amp;nbsp;occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you are currently engaged in activities to advance Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data, please describe&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year began with a major leap. I embarked on a fully open research project. First, I posted our &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/proposal"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8212; a platform that pays scientists to interact openly. We constantly revise the proposal based on feedback. All research is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science"&gt;open notebook&lt;/a&gt;. And we post our analyses upon their&amp;nbsp;conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process has been a thrilling success. Currently &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/leaderboard"&gt;16 contributors&lt;/a&gt; have provided feedback and assistance, earning an estimated $1,136 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; for their 59 comments. Our project has birthed &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/discussion"&gt;32 discussions&lt;/a&gt;, each one a citable work with a dedicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOI&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve made 350 public github &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel"&gt;contributions&lt;/a&gt; this year and published 23 project-related &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel?tab=repositories"&gt;repositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take pleasure in sifting through data, extracting insights, and providing condensed user-friendly derivations. To this end, I have created several websites: a &lt;a href="http://het.io/disease-genes/browse/"&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt; for my results, a &lt;a href="http://git.dhimmel.com/gene-ontology/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; for sets of related genes, and an &lt;a href="http://git.dhimmel.com/SIDER2/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of side effects extracted from drug&amp;nbsp;labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; marked the culmination of an &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705"&gt;independent study&lt;/a&gt; coauthored with &lt;a href="http://www.ksimeonov.com/"&gt;my roommate&lt;/a&gt;. Using only publicly-available data, we identified an association between lung cancer and elevation. The study &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/609054266645426176"&gt;spurred interest&lt;/a&gt; in the topic and received lots of attention. It currently &lt;a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/3060395#score"&gt;ranks&lt;/a&gt; in the 99.9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of articles tracked by Altmetric. &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#questions"&gt;question feature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/cruk-reassessment/"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; served as post-publication venues for further investigation. The study cost no money and illustrates how open data facilitates citizen&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While personally motivated by ideology, I know the move to openness must be driven by incentives. I hope to illustrate the benefits by example, but am also a hardened and vocal advocate. I am committed to &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; licensing for my work. And when training new scientists, open science is a large part of my &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/himmelstein/biological-medical-informatics/36"&gt;curriculum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is your interest in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data and how does it relate to your&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict new uses for existing drugs by mining the union of many diverse datasets. My project integrates over &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/proposal#metanodes"&gt;20 public databases&lt;/a&gt; and depends on open source&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two consequences of open science attract me: hastening discovery and enabling anyone to be a&amp;nbsp;scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I yearn to see the reality behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave"&gt;shadows&lt;/a&gt;. Alone this is impossible; I will always remain a prisoner. But together, through the crossbreeding of our works, we can escape the&amp;nbsp;cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants"&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; from 1676 is no longer true. If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of dwarfs that &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; dwarf the&amp;nbsp;giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How would you use your experience at OpenCon to advance Open Access, Open Education and/or Open&amp;nbsp;Data?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our weapons are immaterial &amp;#8212; crowdsourced knowledge, open source, the public domain, and technical standards &amp;#8212; yet nonetheless require a coordinated&amp;nbsp;sharpening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central authority is antithetical to open science. The open scientist limits herself only by the bounds of possibility and heeds no artificial constraint. How then, without a ruler, does a decentralized community coordinate? Can an army of isolated heretics wage war on a unified front? The soldiers must be brought&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenCon 2015&lt;/em&gt; is that gathering. With an assembly of 163, 13,203 peer-to-peer interactions are possible. And which interactions occur will determine the future of&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="open science"></category><category term="open access"></category><category term="open data"></category><category term="Thinklab"></category><category term="conferences"></category><category term="applications"></category></entry><entry><title>The Cancer Research UK Reassessment of our Lung Cancer versus Elevation Study</title><link href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/cruk-reassessment/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Himmelstein</name></author><id>tag:blog.dhimmel.com,2015-01-15:cruk-reassessment/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank &lt;em&gt;Cancer Research &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for their cancer related advocacy and &lt;a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2015/01/14/does-oxygen-cause-lung-cancer-i-wouldnt-hold-your-breath/" title="Does oxygen cause lung cancer?"&gt;their coverage&lt;/a&gt; of our &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705" title="Lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation"&gt;recent publication&lt;/a&gt;. However, we find several aspects of their interpretation&amp;nbsp;troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we find it unwise to discount our study because it analyzed counties rather than individuals. As &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech.54.5.326" title="The ecological fallacy strikes back"&gt;Professor Pearce explains&lt;/a&gt;, much of our current understanding of cancer risk arose initially from &lt;strong&gt;ecological studies&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the key area in which epidemiologists have been able to &amp;#8220;add value&amp;#8221; has been through this population focus, although this lesson has been forgotten by many modern epidemiologists. For example, many of the recent discoveries on the causes of cancer (including dietary factors and colon cancer, hepatitis B and liver cancer, aflatoxins and liver cancer, human papilloma virus and cervical cancer) have their origins, directly or indirectly, in the systematic international comparisons of cancer incidence conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. These suggested hypotheses concerning the possible causes of the international patterns, which were investigated in more depth in further studies. In some instances these hypotheses were consistent with biological knowledge at the time, but in other instances they were new and striking, and might not have been proposed, or investigated further, if the population level analyses had not been&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to these influential studies of the past, our study benefitted from smaller population units (counties, not states as Ms. Osgun asserts), greater data availability, greater adjustment for potential confounding factors, and modern statistical techniques. Nonetheless, we view our findings as a starting point for further epidemiological and experimental research. In the meantime, we view oxygen-driven tumorigenesis as the most plausible explanation based on established knowledge regarding the underlying&amp;nbsp;biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of oxygen as a carcinogen is neither radical nor novel, as evidenced by the 1978 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; letter titled, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/274606a0" title="Are physiological oxygen concentrations mutagenic?"&gt;Are physiological oxygen concentrations mutagenic?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; (Hint: &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; rarely publishes negative results). Our study alone &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-2"&gt;cites&lt;/a&gt; over a dozen studies supporting oxygen&amp;#8217;s direct role in carcinogenesis. The evidence spans the spectrum from molecular to cellular to organismal and to clinical. Inspired molecular oxygen results in intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species, which lead to mutations. &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019785" title="Ambient Oxygen Promotes Tumorigenesis"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; found mice that were predisposed to cancer took twice as long to develop tumors when housed in low-oxygen chambers. Finally, oxygen toxicity in the human lung is &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1378/chest.88.6.900" title="Pulmonary oxygen toxicity"&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2005.03.008" title="Childhood Cancer Following Neonatal Oxygen Supplementation"&gt;childhood cancer increases following neonatal oxygen supplementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;strong&gt;biological plausibility&lt;/strong&gt;, the criticism identifies four other characteristics of strong epidemiological evidence. We believe our study satisfies these&amp;nbsp;criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting for other factors&lt;/strong&gt;: For lung cancer, we included &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705/table-1" title="Table 1: Predictor information and inclusion."&gt;11 factors&lt;/a&gt; in addition to elevation to adjust for important demographic and cancer-risk factors. These factors include established risk factors (such as smoking, radon, and pollution), lifestyle variables (such as obesity, education, income, and race), and demographics (such as percent male and whether the county is metropolitan). We didn&amp;#8217;t include an age variable because our cancer rates were already age-adjusted to the 2000-census population. Furthermore, the inverse association persisted when we performed the analysis separately within each of the ten states, for males and females, and for those over and under 65 years of age. Since the causal factor appeared to affect every county, every state, both sexes, and all ages, pervasive environmental variables were the most likely confounders. Thus, we evaluated seven environmental variables such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UVB&lt;/span&gt; exposure, temperature, and precipitation. All seven alternative variables produced models over one billion times less likely than the elevation-including&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large numbers&lt;/strong&gt;: The probability of our observed association between lung cancer and elevation occurring by chance is less than one in a quadrillion. After filtering counties to only those with high-quality data, 253 counties remained for lung cancer. In the year 2000, these 253 counties had a combined population of 59,659,978, hardly a small&amp;nbsp;number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbiased&lt;/strong&gt;: We minimized potential biases from a variety of angles. Counties with high migration rates and Native American composition &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705/supp-1" title="Quality Control Filters"&gt;were filtered&lt;/a&gt;. Counties with populations below 10,000 &amp;#8212; whose measurements had greater margins of error &amp;#8212; were excluded, and the remaining counties were weighted by population in the analysis. Finally, we carefully selected the Western United States to minimize extraneous variation, which could cause bias, while capturing the variation in elevation of this mountainous&amp;nbsp;region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;: By definition, every breakthrough finding in science has yet to be reproduced upon discovery. We encourage replication on different regions and with different study designs. Our entire dataset, analysis pipeline, results, and codebase are public to make this task easier for&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criticism mentions the &lt;strong&gt;lag time&lt;/strong&gt; between exposure to cigarette smoke and lung cancer as a potential confounder and considers the recency of our smoking data as the &amp;#8220;likely&amp;#8221; culprit behind elevation&amp;#8217;s association with lung cancer. Let us destruct this argument using data. To assess the change in smoking, &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1478-7954-12-5" title="Cigarette smoking prevalence in US counties: 1996-2012"&gt;we collected county smoking prevalences for 1996 and 2012&lt;/a&gt;. For the counties included in our lung cancer analysis, county smoking prevalence in 1996 was tightly linked to smoking prevalence in 2012 (first panel below). In other words, county smoking prevalences are relatively stable over time and were older smoking data available to us, the effect on our findings would likely be minimal. Next, we found that elevation was only &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; correlated with change in smoking rates over the 16 year period (second panel). For the lag time issue to present a serious omitted-variable bias, elevation and change in smoking would have to be &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; correlated. Finally, we evaluated the correlation between change in smoking and each of the 17 variables included in our lung cancer models. We found that six variables are more correlated with change in smoking than elevation (third panel). In other words, even if the lag time issue were capable of creating a spurious association between elevation and lung cancer, any of six variables we accounted for would prevent this&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The lag time between smoking exposure and cancer is unlikely to confound the elevation association." src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/cruk-reassessment/smoking-lagtime.png" title="Smoking Analysis" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to conclude by reiterating a few points from the paper. First, the elevation association was specific to lung cancer and did not extend to breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, providing evidence for an inhaled carcinogen. Second, the magnitude of the association was large, second only to smoking and responsible for a 12.7% decrease in lung cancer incidence for an 1000 meter rise. The likelihood of spurious associations, and especially ecological fallacy, decreases with effect size. Third, we performed extensive measures to avoid confounding, such as the &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-42"&gt;stratification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-45"&gt;subgrouping&lt;/a&gt; analyses, which Ms. Osgun fails to address. Finally, our publication is open access with a public peer review history, and we released our entire &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/elevcan" title="Project GitHub Repository"&gt;code, analysis, and results&lt;/a&gt;. We took these measures to allow independent verification and evidence-based data-driven reanalysis rather than&amp;nbsp;speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated whether cancer rates varied with altitude. Our primary focus was lung cancer, since the lung comes into direct contact with inhaled air and the level of atmospheric oxygen decreases with elevation. The same reactivity of oxygen that makes it an ideal input for respiration also risks causing cellular damage and mutation. Therefore, we evaluated whether inhaled oxygen is a human carcinogen by investigating the association between cancer and elevation. We analyzed ~250 counties in the Western United States, where the mountainous terrain results in varying elevations and high quality county data is&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that lung cancer decreased dramatically with rising elevation. This trend did not extend to breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer supporting our hypothesis that the elevation-dependent carcinogen is inhaled. The association between lung cancer and elevation remained after accounting for potential confounding factors, such as smoking, pollution, and obesity. Additionally, other environmental variables that could protect against lung cancer, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UVB&lt;/span&gt; exposure (an indicator of sunlight-induced vitamin D synthesis), were unable to replace the effect of&amp;nbsp;elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convey the magnitude of the observed association, we imagine a hypothetical situation where the entire United States elevates to the level of the highest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; county (San Juan, Colorado at 3,473 meters / 11,395 feet). Were all other factors to remain constant, we estimate 65,496 fewer new cases of lung cancer would arise per year. For comparison, 224,210 new cases of lung cancer &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3322/caac.21208" title="Cancer statistics, 2014"&gt;arose&lt;/a&gt; in the United States last&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don&amp;#8217;t recommend anyone relocate just yet and the risk for nonsmokers is low, experimental confirmation of oxygen-driven tumorgenesis could lead to new insights that yield better lung cancer preventions and treatment. Learn more about our findings in the &lt;a href="http://eurekalert.org/e/64Wk" title="Press Release: Can inhaled oxygen cause cancer?"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; or see &lt;em&gt;SciShow&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HrIrB9reWwQ?t=89s"&gt;video summary&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interact with this scatterplot to explore the relationship between elevation and lung cancer. The bivariate plot shows unadjusted lung cancer incidence decreasing with county elevation. The partial regression plot shows the relationship while accounting for additional factors, such as smoking and education. Accounting for the additional factors sharpened the association.

At its core, Facebook is a network (graph) of users (nodes) connected by friendships (edges). Each user exists and experiences content within the confines of their Facebook subgraph, the portion of the network consisting of their friends. When analyzed properly, an individual&amp;#8217;s friendship network paints a historical picture of his or her social&amp;nbsp;engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;#8217;ve created my Facebook friendship network. Nodes represents my friends, and edges represent their friendships. My network contains 1,278 friends with 40,255 friendships amongst themselves. Nearly all of my friends belong to the giant connected component displayed below. Node size indicates degree (number of mutual friends). I applied a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098679" title="ForceAtlas2 Publication - PLOS ONE"&gt;force-directed layout&lt;/a&gt; to organize the network: highly connected nodes are pulled together, while distantly connected nodes are&amp;nbsp;repulsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I would have manually categorized my friends into communities. However, to save time, I classified friends using a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/P10008" title="Fast unfolding of communities in large networks"&gt;community detection algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. The algorithm succeeded in partitioning my friends into communities (denoted by color) that coincided with my past social&amp;nbsp;experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Facebook Friendship Network" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/friendship-network/friendship-network.jpg" title="Facebook Friendship Network" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several interesting phenomena are revealed. The two largest clusters correspond to childhood and college, two highly social and prolonged eras of my life. My hometown friends formed two communities: those who graduated highschool in 2007 or before (purple) and those who graduated after 2007 (blue). My maternal kindred are tightly clustered forming their own community (dark green): my mom is one of sixteen siblings. My brother is the intermediate blue node between my hometown and kin clusters. I went to summer camp for nearly a decade in New Hampshire. These friends (light green community) are proximal but separate from my hometown friends. My 300-mile journey to a college full of new acquaintances manifests in a cluster distant from the rest of the network. At Cornell, I joined a fraternity as well as the debate team. However, only debate forms its own community reflecting the greater social isolation of that activity. Finally, my colleagues and classmates at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; are tightly clustered. The distant offshoot from this cluster represents the individuals I met while participating in a &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/imef-guatemala/" title="Innovation in Medical Education Forum"&gt;medical education forum in Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage my readers to play around with their own friendship networks. One interesting aspect is discovering the friends which bridge one&amp;#8217;s various communities. Additionally, unconnected nodes most commonly indicate serendipitous encounters or sockpuppet accounts. I used the &lt;a href="https://apps.facebook.com/netvizz/" title="Facebook netvizz App"&gt;netvizz app&lt;/a&gt; to extract my friendship network from Facebook and &lt;a href="https://gephi.github.io/" title="Gephi Homepage"&gt;Gephi&lt;/a&gt; for&amp;nbsp;visualization.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="networks"></category><category term="modules"></category><category term="facebook"></category><category term="friendship"></category><category term="social network analysis"></category><category term="graphs"></category><category term="netvizz"></category></entry><entry><title>Innovation in Medical Education Forum</title><link href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/imef-guatemala/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-19T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Himmelstein</name></author><id>tag:blog.dhimmel.com,2013-11-19:imef-guatemala/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the first week of October in 2013, I traveled to Guatemala. The &lt;a href="https://www.ufm.edu/index.php/Portal" title="Universidad Francisco Marroquin Homepage"&gt;Universidad Francisco Marroquín&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt;) hosted a &lt;a href="http://noticias.ufm.edu/index.php?title=Innovation_in_Medical_Education_Forum%2C_en_la_UFM" title="Innovation_in_Medical_Education_Forum%2C_en_la_UFM"&gt;forum of 30 innovators and medical professionals&lt;/a&gt; to envision the future of healthcare and medical education. The forum produced suggestions for a new medical degree, based on embracing disruptions, which would initially coexist with the current medical&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt; is well positioned to innovate education. Founded under free market ideals, the school is characterized by an entrepreneurial spirit and includes two business schools. As a private school without an endowment, tenured faculty, accreditation, or government funding, the school is optimized for&amp;nbsp;adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants included individuals supported by the &lt;a href="http://thielfoundation.org/" title="Thiel Foundation Homepage"&gt;Thiel Foundation&lt;/a&gt; as well as faculty from &lt;a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/" title="Harvard Medical School Homepage"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;, which offers student exchange with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several ideas came to the forefront as the forum&amp;nbsp;progressed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students should not complete a unit unless they have mastered the subject material. Variable learning rates are poorly accommodated by traditional academic&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development efforts should focus on the interactive portions of the curriculum. Consumption based learning can be outsourced. Open online courses provide world-class and cutting-edge education at little cost and enable coursework away from campus – for example, while providing care in the&amp;nbsp;countryside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctors should be just-in-time learners. Physicians need the ability to stay current in a rapidly changing field. The ability to effectively retrieve and integrate literature will be&amp;nbsp;crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology will continue to play a growing role in medicine eventually supplanting many of the current duties of a physician. Future physicians should be prepared to effectively embrace and explain these&amp;nbsp;technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients are costumers. Like any business, medicine should deliver services that the customer desires. Striving for customer satisfaction would help simplify the process of purchasing medical services and emphasize the often overlooked aspect of empathic&amp;nbsp;care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bioinformatics is an auspicious field given its low barriers to entry. Contracted bioinformatics projects could reduce tuition while providing an educational research experience for&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the &lt;a href="http://noticias.ufm.edu/index.php?title=Cientificos_y_emprendedores_en_la_UFM" title="Cientificos_y_emprendedores_en_la_UFM"&gt;opportunity to explore the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt; campus&lt;/a&gt; and was thoroughly impressed by the design, hospitality, principles, and foresight of the institution. While visiting the campus, I was interviewed about my views on accessibility and communication in science.
