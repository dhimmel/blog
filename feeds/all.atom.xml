I was fortunate to receive the fellowship, which has funded the bulk of my PhD since its third&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of each fellowship year, fellows submit an Annual Activities Report, which includes a written Fellowship Year Summary. Below I&amp;#8217;ve reproduced my summaries from the last four years. But first, here&amp;#8217;s a screenshot of the&amp;nbsp;prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Fellowship Year Summary prompt" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/nsf-year-summaries/prompt.png" title="Prompt for the Fellowship Year Summary" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-201213-dated-april-1-2013"&gt;Summary of 2012–13 dated April 1,&amp;nbsp;2013&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012–2013 reporting period spans my first and second years of graduate school. The first year of graduate school consisted of coursework, seminars, and rotations. My first rotation, supervised by Dr. Ryan Hernandez, focused on human evolution and population genomics. I simulated sequencing data capturing the complexity of human demographic history. During my second rotation with Dr. John Witte, I compared the prevalence of gene-gene associations with disease under additive and epistatic disease models. The project, related to my original &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; proposal, resulted in a poster presentation at the &lt;em&gt;American Society of Human Genetics Annual Meeting&lt;/em&gt;. In my third rotation, with Dr. Sergio Baranzini, I worked on modelling biological entities using heterogeneous networks. The project consisted of parsing and integrating publicly available databases. Professor Baranzini is now my advisor. My project aims to discover new uses for existing drugs using a network-based computational link prediction&amp;nbsp;technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my Personal Statement, I think science could be improved by better communication. Communication includes a broad range of issues ranging from writing style to open-access publishing. Over the past year, I’ve stressed my own ability to communicate. Professor Hernandez requested me as the teaching assistant for a new course he was teaching called &lt;em&gt;Computational Evolutionary Genomics&lt;/em&gt;. As part of the quarter long course, I led weekly discussion sections. I’ve also honed my communication skills through presentations to lab members, students, and&amp;nbsp;faculty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I’ve begun to apply my interest in high-throughput computationally intensive problems to medicine. Through my research on drug repurposing, I not only hope to find new disease therapies, but also spread my scientific methodologies through improved scientific&amp;nbsp;communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-201314-dated-march-31-2014"&gt;Summary of 2013–14 dated March 31,&amp;nbsp;2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;/strong&gt;: Over the past year, my research has matured extensively. My project aims to identify genes associated with complex human diseases. My findings will help with disease susceptibility prediction and understanding what biological characteristics underlie pathogenic variants. The cross-disciplinary method improves on a technique first developed for social network analysis and relies on advanced machine learning and distributed computing. I applied for and received a $2,000 &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; Graduate Student Research Fellowship&lt;/em&gt; to add &lt;span class="caps"&gt;192GB&lt;/span&gt; of low-latency memory to our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HPC&lt;/span&gt; workstation. In the past year, I exhibited the work at the &lt;em&gt;American Society of Human Genetics Annual Meeting&lt;/em&gt; and presented it at the &lt;em&gt;Biomedical Computation at Stanford Symposium&lt;/em&gt;. I also discuss the project in a &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/GPAvruPpZ3A" title="YouTube · ISMB 2014 Late Breaking Research Proposal"&gt;public youtube video&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;nbsp;created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;: My vision for science is one of greater accessibility and communication. I helped other students achieve proficiency in written communication as a teaching assistant for our program&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Writing Predoctoral Fellowships&lt;/em&gt; course. Personally, I assisted with peer-reviewing a journal manuscript and writing a grant proposal. In October, I traveled to Guatemala to participate in a &lt;em&gt;Forum on Innovation in Medical Education&lt;/em&gt;. Hosted by a private, forward-thinking University, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt;, the forum focused on designing a new medical degree program based on embracing disruptions. Throughout the forum I suggested ways for strong communication and accessibility to be embedded into the structure of the new curriculum. I am an outspoken advocate of open access publishing allowing unlimited reuse with attribution. I also support developments to make science more transparent and incremental. To that end, I have developed a &lt;a href="http://dhimmel.com/" title="Homepage of Daniel Himmelstein"&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt; describing my research and have begun posting material to &lt;a href="https://figshare.com/authors/Daniel_Himmelstein/523637" title="Daniel Himmelstein on figshare"&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-201415-dated-march-18-2015"&gt;Summary of 2014–15 dated March 18,&amp;nbsp;2015&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;/strong&gt;: My research focuses on making novel biological predictions from heterogeneous networks. Heterogeneous networks contain multiple entity and relationship types making them an ideal approach for data integration. Applying our edge prediction algorithm to a multiscale network of pathogenesis, we successfully predicted disease-associated genes, uncovered multiple sclerosis risk genes, and highlighted the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. This study is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/011569" title="bioRxiv · Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes"&gt;currently available&lt;/a&gt; as a preprint. In July, I gave my first talk at a major international conference, when I presented this research at the &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology&lt;/em&gt; conference in Boston, supported by an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt;-funded travel fellowship. Furthermore, our study was &lt;a href="http://biomedicalcomputationreview.org/content/unlocking-genetics-complex-diseases-gwas-and-beyond" title="Unlocking the Genetics of Complex Diseases: GWAS and Beyond"&gt;featured&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Biomedical Computation Review&lt;/em&gt;, a quarterly magazine produced by&amp;nbsp;Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we plan to identify new uses for existing drugs using our network-based approach. We hope to bring new life to the sluggish and increasingly expensive drug discovery process. Interested parties can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4" title="Repurposing drugs on a heterogeneous network"&gt;follow and contribute&lt;/a&gt; to this project in&amp;nbsp;real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;: In the last year, I have taken many steps to move science closer to my vision of openness. Realizing that science moves faster and reproducibility improves when source code is open, I made 156 public &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel" title="Daniel Himmelstein on GitHub"&gt;contributions on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, I created a website (&lt;a href="http://het.io/" title="Heterogeneous networks in bioinformatics"&gt;het.io&lt;/a&gt;) covering our research on heterogeneous networks. We provide our predictions of disease-associated genes through an interactive &lt;a href="http://het.io/disease-genes/browse/" title="hetio · Disease-Associated Gene Browser"&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt;. I also started a &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/" title="Satoshi Village · the blog of Daniel Himmelstein"&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; that aims to communicate science to a broad readership. Similarly, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; hosted a &lt;em&gt;three minute thesis&lt;/em&gt; competition, where students present their dissertation research with a general audience in mind. Although my submission was not selected as a finalist, I posted the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oV3Wx14E7WE" title="YouTube · 2014 Three Minute Thesis Entry at UCSF"&gt;recording online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; also hosts a seminar series that accepts student speaker nominations. My nomination of Lior Pachter — professor at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt; Berkeley and author of the &lt;a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/" title="Bits of DNA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bits of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; blog — was accepted and I was fortunate to arrange his visit and discuss science with him. Finally, I performed my first &lt;a href="https://publons.com/review/65947/" title="Publons review of 'Optimal Algorithm for Metabolomics Classification and Feature Selection varies by Dataset'"&gt;solo peer review&lt;/a&gt; for the open access journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="http://blog.peerj.com/post/97879213303/save-the-date-participative-bay-area-oa-week" title="PeerJ blog · Bay Area OA week event for Generation Open"&gt;Bay Area open access event&lt;/a&gt;, I met the founder of &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/" title="Thinklab · a community for real-time open collaborative science"&gt;Thinklab&lt;/a&gt;, a nascent platform for massively collaborative open science. Our project on drug repurposing is one of the initial projects using the platform. Thinklab has funded our proposal and rewards community participants for contributing to the project. We have high hopes that the &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/blog/introducing-thinklab-a-platform-for-massively-collaborative-open-science/38" title="Introducing ThinkLab — A platform for massively collaborative open science"&gt;Thinklab model&lt;/a&gt; can accelerate science, help reproducibility, and encourage transparent&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-201516-dated-march-6-2016"&gt;Summary of 2015–16 dated March 6,&amp;nbsp;2016&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;/strong&gt;: For the last year, I&amp;#8217;ve been constructing a network for drug repurposing. We will use the network to predict the probability that a given drug–disease pair is an efficacious treatment. Since the network contains multiple node and relationships types, it&amp;#8217;s called a hetnet — a term we&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d104" title="Thinklab discussion · Renaming ‘heterogeneous networks’ to a more concise and catchy term"&gt;formally popularizing&lt;/a&gt;. Our hope is that by integrating diverse data types, the hetnet will form a foundation for powerful&amp;nbsp;analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d112" title="Thinklab discussion · Using the neo4j graph database for hetnets"&gt;migrated&lt;/a&gt; to using the Neo4j graph database to store and operate on our hetnets. Leveraging this mature open source technology has improved our interoperability and provided new capabilities. Our &lt;a href="http://portal.graphgist.org/graph_gists/drug-repurposing-by-hetnet-relationship-prediction-a-new-hope" title="Neo4j GraphGist · Drug repurposing by hetnet relationship prediction: a new hope"&gt;interactive tutorial&lt;/a&gt; showcases our project and use of the Neo4j&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build our hetnet, we created several intermediate resources. We&amp;#8217;re particularly excited about three resources that we think the community will appreciate. First, we created a catalog of medical indications, which can be used to train and evaluate computational methods. The catalog was created by integrating four existing resources. However, we &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d95" title="Thinklab discussion · Expert curation of our indication catalog for disease-modifying treatments"&gt;recruited&lt;/a&gt; three physicians to review each drug–disease pair and classify it as disease-modifying or symptomatic. Second, we computed &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d43#6" title="Thinklab discussion · Computing consensus transcriptional profiles for LINCS L1000 perturbations"&gt;consensi signatures&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LINCS&lt;/span&gt; L1000, which profiles transcriptional responses to perturbation. Third, we created a &lt;a href="http://git.dhimmel.com/gene-ontology/" title="User-friendly and customizable Gene Ontology annotations"&gt;user-friendly webapp&lt;/a&gt; for retrieving Gene Ontology&amp;nbsp;annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;: To construct our hetnet, we integrated 28 public resources. Even though the resources were publicly funded, copyright and access agreements created a major licensing headache. After a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d107" title="Thinklab discussion · Integrating resources with disparate licensing into an open network"&gt;7,500+ word discussion&lt;/a&gt; involving lawyers and other experts, we settled on the least bad way&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since undergoing this copyꞃightmare and realizing that a crisis looms, I&amp;#8217;ve become an advocate for data copyright and licensing reform in science. I presented on the legal problems related to data reuse at &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2Y2OIutYE4Y" title="YouTube · Copyright vs open science - Project Presentation at OpenCon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenCon&lt;/em&gt; in Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and at a local &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Jy-E7PheIRs" title="YouTube · Realtime Open Science on Thinklab &amp;amp; The Horrors of Data Copyright"&gt;Open Access Week event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been performing realtime, open notebook science using Thinklab and GitHub. Our drug repurposing &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4" title="Thinklab Project · Repurposing drugs on a hetnet"&gt;project on Thinklab&lt;/a&gt; has generated 60 discussions containing 346 comments by 8 project team members and 29 community reviewers. Getting feedback in the early stages of our project has strengthened our project while helping us avoid poor uses of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I reviewed for &lt;a href="https://publons.com/review/245916/" title="Publons review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://publons.com/review/173426/" title="Publons review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; authored 906 public &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel" title="Daniel Himmelstein on GitHub"&gt;GitHub contributions&lt;/a&gt;; mentored an apprentice and an intern; and crafted a &lt;a href="https://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook" title="Slides · The Data Biologist Cookbook"&gt;data biologist cookbook&lt;/a&gt; for the new&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, while waiting for my accepted &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259" title="Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; to be published, I grew frustrated by the delays. I compared the delays at several journals in my field and &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/plos-and-publishing-delays/" title="Publication delays at PLOS and 3,475 other journals"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; the findings. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/523131f" title="Long wait for publication plagues many journals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://thepublicationplan.com/2015/07/02/publication-and-acceptance-times-for-over-3000-journals/" title="Publication and acceptance times for over 3,000 journals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Publication Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; covered my findings. Later I performed a more &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/history-of-delays/" title="The history of publishing delays"&gt;comprehensive analysis&lt;/a&gt; on the history of publishing delays, which was also covered by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/530148a" title="The Waiting Game · Does it take too long to publish research?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://thepublicationplan.com/2016/02/19/are-publishing-delays-getting-worse/" title="Are publishing delays getting worse?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Publication Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. My goal with this research is to help researchers avoid excessive delays while replacing anecdote with evidence in the contemporary discussion of scientific&amp;nbsp;publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reflections"&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll close with four&amp;nbsp;reflections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My productivity exceeded linear growth over the four year period. Experience has played a role, in addition to the rise of open source tools for data&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of hyperlinks per year has grown rapidly from 0 to 3 to 13 to 21. I attribute much of this increase to open science, which has led to more public output per unit of research&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deadline has always been May 1, yet each year I&amp;#8217;ve finished the summary further in advance than the year before. Am I becoming less&amp;nbsp;just-in-time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have yet to &amp;#8220;discover new uses for existing drugs&amp;#8221; despite aiming for this in 2013. Let&amp;#8217;s make 2016 the&amp;nbsp;year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><category term="NSF"></category><category term="National Science Foundation"></category><category term="GRFP"></category><category term="GRF"></category><category term="fellowship"></category><category term="annual activity report"></category><category term="fellowship year summary"></category></entry><entry><title>The history of publishing delays</title><link href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/history-of-delays/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-02-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Himmelstein</name></author><id>tag:blog.dhimmel.com,2016-02-10:history-of-delays/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last June, I &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/plos-and-publishing-delays/#journals_wrapper" title="Publication delays at PLOS and 3,475 other journals"&gt;released a summary&lt;/a&gt; of the recent publishing delays at 3,475 journals. The post attracted lots of attention via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/615624280026394625" title="Tweet introducing data on publication and acceptance delays for 3,482 journals"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/523131f" title="Long wait for publication plagues many journals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, primarily because scientists are frustrated with the sluggish pace of&amp;nbsp;publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a major question remained. Are publication delays getting shorter or longer? Kendall Powell, writing a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/530148a" title="The Waiting Game"&gt;feature for &lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released in tandem with this post, contacted me. Her investigation had uncovered a widespread belief that delays were worsening with time. But she wanted data, and the existing data was &lt;a href="http://wp.me/p4Ir7n-5Y" title="Waiting to Happen: Publication lag times in Cell Biology Journals"&gt;field specific&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.12-0901ufm" title="The Glacial Pace of Scientific Publishing"&gt;anecdotal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set out to uncover the history of publishing delays. Using PubMed, I&amp;nbsp;extracted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;acceptance delays&lt;/strong&gt;—days from receival to acceptance—for 3,330,333 articles since&amp;nbsp;1965&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;publishing delays&lt;/strong&gt;—days from acceptance to online publication—for 2,765,750 articles since&amp;nbsp;1997&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;through the end of 2015. PubMed relies on publishers to deposit history dates. Frequently, publishers opt not to provide histories, and occasionally they provide erroneous dates. As a result, publishing delays for many journals will be missing or&amp;nbsp;incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="acceptance-delays"&gt;Acceptance&amp;nbsp;delays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time between submission and acceptance encapsulates editorial decision, peer review, and revision. Below, we visualize 35 years of acceptance delays. Each year, the green lines indicate delay percentiles, spaced every 2.5 points with quartiles bolded. The gray band displays a curve fitted for all articles over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Acceptance delay versus year accepted" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/delays/59310065e325c71e7d121be240a0a3bc60875cc4/viz/acceptance-by-article.png" title="35 years of acceptance delays" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of journals reporting acceptance delays prior to 1981 &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/delays/blob/59310065e325c71e7d121be240a0a3bc60875cc4/data/yearly-summaries.tsv" title="Table with yearly publishing delay summaries"&gt;is in&lt;/a&gt; the single digits, so drawing conclusions on those early years would be premature. However since 1981, the median acceptance delay has teetered around the 100 day mark. So on a per article level, acceptance delays don&amp;#8217;t appear to be worsening. If anything, long delays are becoming less frequent as evidenced by the downward sloping third quartile line and best-fit curve since&amp;nbsp;1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in a specific journal? Use the box below to select from 3,086 journals with acceptance delay histories. Red dots represent individual&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;select id="select-accept" style="width:100%"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;img id="delay-img-accept" title="Acceptance delay history" style="width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="publication-delays"&gt;Publication&amp;nbsp;delays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online publication &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/3336451.0003.212" title="Electronic Journals and Scholarly Communication"&gt;began in the ’90s&lt;/a&gt; and quickly became standard. Nowadays, since print rarely precedes online access, an article&amp;#8217;s online debut is its effective date of publication. Conveniently in PubMed, precise dates are considerably more available for online compared to print&amp;nbsp;publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time between acceptance and online publication encapsulates typesetting, proofing, and occasionally press releasing. The plot below shows the history of online publication delays since 2000, the first year with a double-digit number of&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Publication delay versus year published" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/delays/59310065e325c71e7d121be240a0a3bc60875cc4/viz/publication-by-article.png" title="16 years of online publication delays" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publication delays have approximately been cut in half since the early 2000s. Progress hit a plateau in 2009 with the median delay stabilizing around 25 days. However, the longest delays steadily decreased up until&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings illustrate the transformative power of the digital age: publication speed doubled and now greater transparency will bring scrutiny to the stragglers, who will hopefully pick up their pace. Below, select from 2,756 journals with publication delay&amp;nbsp;histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;select id="select-publish" style="width:100%"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;img id="delay-img-publish" title="Online publishing delay history" style="width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="journal-trends"&gt;Journal&amp;nbsp;trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last decade witnessed the rise of the megajournal. By &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.981" title="Björk (2015) PeerJ"&gt;rapidly publishing a large quantity&lt;/a&gt; of articles, megajournals could be driving article-level delay trends. So what about journal-level delay trends? If you select a random journal, are you more likely to see increasing or decreasing&amp;nbsp;delays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each journal, I regressed article delay versus date. The resulting slope indicates the average number of days a journal&amp;#8217;s delays increased per year. The distributions of these slopes are shown below. Dashes indicate quartiles and crosses indicate&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Journal-level delay trends" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/delays/59310065e325c71e7d121be240a0a3bc60875cc4/viz/slope-distributions.png" title="Violin plots of change in delay distributions" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;69% percent of journals experienced decreasing publication delays. However in terms of acceptance delays, journals were roughly split between quickening and slowing. These findings suggest that the article-level trends above are generally occurring amongst journals, rather than being dominated by a few&amp;nbsp;megajournals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, here are some limitations the reader should be aware&amp;nbsp;of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PubMed contains erroneous dates. However, we apply quality controls such as removing negative delays and zero-day&amp;nbsp;acceptances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depositing dates in PubMed is optional leading to the potential for selection&amp;nbsp;bias.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1511912112" title="Accelerating scientific publication in biology"&gt;overall time till publication&lt;/a&gt; is outside the scope of this analysis. Growing manuscripts, rejection rates, and author lists could make the overall publication process more laborious even if individual journals are becoming&amp;nbsp;quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no standard for PubMed&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;receival&lt;/code&gt; date. Some journals use the date of initial submission while others use resubmission or revised-submission&amp;nbsp;dates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://svpow.com/2012/10/03/dear-royal-society-please-stop-lying-to-us-about-publication-times/" title="Dear Royal Society, please stop lying to us about publication times"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that journals favor decisions of &amp;#8220;reject and resubmit&amp;#8221; rather than &amp;#8220;revise&amp;#8221; to shorten their reported acceptance delays. &lt;a href="http://smallpondscience.com/2015/05/20/what-ever-happened-to-major-and-minor-revisions/" title="What ever happened to major and minor revisions?"&gt;Some feel&lt;/a&gt; this practice is increasing with&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisional publication—whereby publishers release a pre-typeset article (generally as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; only) prior to complete online publication—blurs the meaning of&amp;nbsp;publication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeaway here is that, as a whole, PubMed acceptance delays likely underestimate the actual time it takes to get a manuscript accepted. I encourage readers to explore and build on this analysis, which is &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/delays/tree/history-blog-post" title="GitHub Repository: dhimmel/delays at history-blog-post"&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and citeable via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOI&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.45516" title="Zenodo deposition of the GitHub repository for this analysis"&gt;10.5281/zenodo.45516&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing delays haven&amp;#8217;t ballooned. However, there&amp;#8217;s plenty of room for improvement. I&amp;#8217;d like to see existing journals strive towards acceptance within two months and publication within two weeks. In the meantime, scientists looking to circumvent delays should consider &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/preprints-2015/" title="The preprint in 2015 and what comes next"&gt;preprinting&lt;/a&gt; or realtime platforms such as &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/" title="A community for realtime open collaborative science"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While posting manuscripts prior to peer review and journal publication &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.2700v2.pdf" title="arXiv · It was twenty years ago today …"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; long been practiced in physics, preprints are just catching on in the&amp;nbsp;biosciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, labs &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@greenescientist/why-we-preprint-fb3bfbcdf4ff" title="Why we preprint"&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; universally preprinting, and preprints &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1511912112" title="Accelerating scientific publication in biology"&gt;were billed&lt;/a&gt; as the solution to accelerating an ever more laborious publishing&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give some context, &lt;em&gt;PeerJ PrePrints&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; both launched in 2013. Prior to 2015, &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/dhimmel/81f55d62af27197a845e" title="Growth of bioscience preprints in 2015"&gt;on average&lt;/a&gt; 1.2 preprints per day compared to 2.4 for &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;. Yet in 2015, &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; averaged 2.3 per day while &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; averaged 4.9. Since together &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; published only 2,626 preprints in 2015 while PubMed grew by 1,082,213 articles, the ~100% annual growth in preprinting could persist for the next several&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/blog/post/115284878288/a-peerj-preprint-so-just-what-is-that-exactly/" title="A PeerJ PrePrint – so just what is that exactly?"&gt;incentives&lt;/a&gt; for preprinting will likely spur continued growth. In short, the benefits—establishing precedent and increased article lifespan—outweigh the disadvantages—ineligibility to a &lt;a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/browse.php?colour=white&amp;amp;la=en&amp;amp;fIDnum=|&amp;amp;mode=simple" title="SHERPA/RoMEO List of white publishers"&gt;dwindling set&lt;/a&gt; of démodé journals. While preprint servers may not provide the same visibility as journal, they can still be influential. For example, my first preprint &lt;a href="http://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook#/2/2" title="Data Biologist Cookbook: Unlocking the Genetics of Complex Diseases"&gt;was featured&lt;/a&gt; in a review, and my second &lt;a href="http://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook#/2/1" title="Data Biologist Cookbook: Oxygen driven tumorigenesis"&gt;drove interest&lt;/a&gt; in the&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final drawback is the &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/11/1/the-google-scholar-preprint-bug/" title="The Google Scholar preprint bug"&gt;Google Scholar bug&lt;/a&gt;, where the existence of a preprint prevents subsequent journal publication from appearing in the Google Scholar database. Despite &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/12/2/how-google-scholar-discourages-young-scientists-from-posting-preprints/" title="How Google Scholar discourages young scientists from posting preprints"&gt;discouraging&lt;/a&gt; openness and &lt;a href="http://serialmentor.com/blog/2015/10/8/Google-Scholar-bug-redux/" title="The Google Scholar preprint bug redux"&gt;frequently occurring&lt;/a&gt;, the bug is &lt;a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/05/guest-post-highwires-john-sack-on-online-indexing-of-scholarly-publications-part-1-what-we-all-have-accomplished/#comment-155918" title="Post by Anurag Acharya on the Scholarly Kitchen"&gt;considered a &amp;#8220;feature&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by Scholar&amp;#8217;s creator, so don&amp;#8217;t expect a resolution anytime&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cruel twist is the longer the publishing delay, the &lt;a href="http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/05/guest-post-highwires-john-sack-on-online-indexing-of-scholarly-publications-part-1-what-we-all-have-accomplished/#comment-155925" title="Post by Anurag Acharya on the Scholarly Kitchen"&gt;greater the chance&lt;/a&gt; of triggering the Scholar preprint bug. For example, my first study on hetnets experienced a delay of 105 days from acceptance to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259" title="Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes"&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt; on July 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Now, 179 days later, Google Scholar still only indexes the &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprint. Double&amp;nbsp;whammy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While preprints are a workaround for excessive publication delays, their current incarnations are limited. There has been little preprint innovation since &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/677899029976473600" title="Tweet: Little innovation in preprint servers since 1997"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; preprints are still &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; only, with no web display, although &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; appears to be aware of this problem given their creation of &lt;a href="https://github.com/PeerJ/paper-now" title="Create, edit and display a journal article, entirely in GitHub"&gt;paper-now&lt;/a&gt;, a GitHub Pages solution to&amp;nbsp;publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints bring us closer to open science, which has been &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LwW1-X3glak" title="Open research video"&gt;defined as&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scientists sharing their research with the world as soon as they record it for&amp;nbsp;themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints help counteract publishing delays, which are by definition anti-open. However, preprints are not a panacea! Withholding publication until a study is complete is a major obstacle towards greater scientific&amp;nbsp;efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is most helpful early on, when mistakes are still rectifiable. And scientific outputs are often must useful when young, while still state of the art. Platforms such as &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/" title="A community for real-time open collaborative science"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://riojournal.com/" title="Research Ideas and Outcomes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com" title="GitHub"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; now allow collaborative open science from a project&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, I&amp;#8217;m performing my &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4" title="Repurposing drugs on a heterogeneous network"&gt;current project&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;. In the last year, 22 community &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/leaderboard" title="Project leaderboard on Thinklab"&gt;participants&lt;/a&gt; contributed feedback across 57 &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/discussion" title="Project discussions on Thinklab"&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;ve created lots of valuable content that&amp;#8217;s been accruing views, citations, and page rank—none of which would exist had we withheld sharing until completing a&amp;nbsp;preprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I wholeheartedly recommend preprinting, I encourage those interested in major scientific disruption to look&amp;nbsp;further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, here are three recommendations for maximizing the potential of your science with&amp;nbsp;preprints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release your preprint under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" title="Creative Commons — Attribution 4.0 International"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; license to encourage reuse and hence&amp;nbsp;citation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat your preprint as a publication: all data and code needed to reproduce the study should be available and appropriately&amp;nbsp;licensed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to update your preprint with revisions. Help readers stay up to date while gaining visibility on the recents&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/li&gt;

EMPs are short bursts of energy that can fry electronics. Large scale EMPs can be triggered by solar flares or high altitude nuclear detonations. A hefty nuclear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; could destroy unprotected electronic equipment within a thousand miles radius. The podcast motivated me recount my strange story involving EMPs and slime&amp;nbsp;molds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="arguing-the-unforeseen"&gt;Arguing the&amp;nbsp;unforeseen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year was 2010. I was a junior at Cornell, where I was on the debate team. In policy debate, there is a single topic for the entire year. And this year the topic was nuclear weapons. The season was in full swing. My partner and I were preparing for the National Debate Tournament&amp;nbsp;qualifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had qualified our sophomore year, but only by the skin of our teeth. We needed a single ballot in the final round of the qualifiers, but were paired against a seemingly invincible opponent from Harvard. After the debate, expecting defeat, we nervously waited for the last judge to cast his ballot. Minutes turned to hours. Finally, the judge marked his vote, folded the ballot, and handed it to an elderset guru of the activity to&amp;nbsp;announce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did it! I jumped up to embrace my partner and accidentally kneed him in the&amp;nbsp;balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to repeat the suspense, we were preparing vigorously for this year&amp;#8217;s qualifier. To catch the opponents off guard, we had to prepare a novel proposal — one that had not been debated by any of the thousands of teams nationwide that&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon the topic of nuclear EMPs. Information was scant. Whether the major superpowers even considered high altitude detonation in their nuclear planning was poorly documented. My sources were fringe. I even had to order a &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/0964764369" title="High-Altitude Nuclear War by John Lewallen"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; because no university libraries carried it. Nevertheless, we pieced together a proposal to ban high altitude nuclear explosions to reduce the likelihood of debilitating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing your own arguments is not essential for debate. But picking winning arguments is. Policy debate assumes an environment of natural selection: throughout a season, the arguments that survive are likely the most&amp;nbsp;veracious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, in the midst of sensationalism designed to outweigh the opponent&amp;#8217;s criticism, I sensed a certain truth to our argument. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; threat is real and our society is ill-prepared. Ironically, we lost the one and only debate where we deployed this&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, finally posting the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1487717" title="Cornell HKs EMP affirmative from the 2009-2010 collegiate policy debate season"&gt;130 page compilation&lt;/a&gt; of evidence we compiled for a single loss will provide some&amp;nbsp;closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="meanwhile-in-the-land-of-slime"&gt;Meanwhile in the land of&amp;nbsp;slime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same semester, I came across a study on slime mold, presumably via &lt;a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/10/01/22/1715229/slime-mold-could-lead-to-better-tech" title="Slime Mold Could Lead To Better Tech"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; because I didn&amp;#8217;t have Twitter yet. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1177894" title="Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; used a slime mold species, &lt;em&gt;Physarum polycephalum&lt;/em&gt;, to create a blueprint of Tokyo&amp;#8217;s railway&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slime mold was unlike any life form I had seen. In its vegetative state, called a plasmodium, the slime mold forms a gigantic single cell containing many nuclei. It moves by pulsating, generally in search of its preferred food source, &lt;a href="http://www.quakeroats.com/" title="Quaker Oats Homepage"&gt;Quaker Oats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="videoWrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe width="604" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lls27hu03yw?start=10&amp;feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=light&amp;showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reconstruct the Tokyo railway, researchers placed Quaker Oats in a petri dish corresponding to population centers. Since slime mold detests light, the researchers illuminated areas corresponding to geographic no-nos such as lakes and mountains. Originating downtown, the slime mold initially expanded throughout the petri dish. Then the slime mold retracted to form a tubular network connecting the food sources. When analyzed for efficiency, cost, and fault tolerance, these networks were often comparable or superior to the real&amp;nbsp;deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-slime-and-emp-converge"&gt;The slime and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;converge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, my junior spring, I took the best course of my Cornell experience, &lt;a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info2040_2010sp/" title="Computer Science 2850, Cornell University, Spring 2010"&gt;networks&lt;/a&gt;. The final paper asked for an &amp;#8220;exploration of a topic related to the course.&amp;#8221; I &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1488841" title="Biologically inspired designs for restoring power transmission after an electromagnetic pulse attack"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; using slime mold networks to reconstruct the power grid after an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; attack. Food sources would represent power plants. Slime mold would be tasked with reconnecting the power grid, but constrained by a light gradient representing the&amp;nbsp;blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://wl.figshare.com/articles/1488841/embed?show_title=0" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; had a short lived debate appearance, it did help me get an &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; in&amp;nbsp;class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-slime-still-slithers"&gt;The slime still&amp;nbsp;slithers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second year of my PhD at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt;, I was required to present at a journal club. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215037109" title="Slime mold uses an externalized spatial memory to navigate in complex environments"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using the same species of slime mold as before caught my interest. The study found that the plasmodium deposits a slime trail, which it exploits for spacial memory. In other words, when foraging for Quaker Oats, the slime mold preferentially explores untrotted areas. The &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/himmelstein/slime-mold-short" title="Intelligent slime mold, but can it remember?"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; from my presentation are&amp;nbsp;below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let me celebrate the completion of this blog post with a bottle of Avery&amp;#8217;s Toxic Slime electric blue &lt;a href="http://www.averysoda.com/TotallyGrossSoda.html" title="Avery's Totally Gross Sodas"&gt;soda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="EMP"></category><category term="electromagnetic pulse"></category><category term="slime mold"></category><category term="debate"></category><category term="Cornell HK"></category><category term="nuclear weapons"></category><category term="Cornell"></category></entry><entry><title>Publication delays at PLOS and 3,475 other journals</title><link href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/plos-and-publishing-delays/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-29T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Himmelstein</name></author><id>tag:blog.dhimmel.com,2015-06-29:plos-and-publishing-delays/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On April 22, 2015 my research was formally accepted to &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;. 68 days later the article has yet to be published. My &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4" title="Thinklab · Repurposing drugs on a heterogeneous network"&gt;current project&lt;/a&gt; builds on the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/011569" title="bioRxiv · Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes"&gt;forthcoming study&lt;/a&gt; and would benefit from its publication. Frustrated, I decided to investigate whether such delays are commonplace at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="publication-and-acceptance-delays-at-plos"&gt;Publication and acceptance delays at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by retrieving all PubMed records for the 7 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals. For each journal, I randomly selected 1000 articles and scraped the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; website for receival, acceptance, and publication timestamps. Using this scraped data, I plotted publishing delays over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PLOS publication times from website scraping" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/scraped-plos-publication-times.png" title="Scraped PLOS publication times" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not alone! Starting in 2011, publications delays at &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; began regularly breaching 80 days. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt; experienced similar publishing delay explosions in 2011, although appear to have recently improved. These extreme temporal fluctuations suggest that delays are not an innate and immutable characteristic of publishing, but instead dependent on operational efficiency and organizational&amp;nbsp;well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two oldest and most established &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals, &lt;em&gt;Biology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, followed a different pattern: long delays in their early years followed by stability at 40 days since 2009. The dearth of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Biology&lt;/em&gt; records prior to 2009, resulted from broken &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOI&lt;/span&gt; redirects. Before my scraper finished its duties, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/613842560360951808" title="Twitter · PLOS Biology DOI resolution error"&gt;fixed the issue&lt;/a&gt; resulting in the few visible &lt;em&gt;Biology&lt;/em&gt; articles of that&amp;nbsp;period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scraped data is nice because it comes directly from the source, but is time intensive and limited to a single webpage layout. Therefore, I also extracted timestamps from PubMed. Below I show publication (solid lines) and acceptance (dotted lines) times from this larger&amp;nbsp;dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PLOS acceptance and publication times from PubMed" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/plos-stages.png" title="PLOS acceptance times (dotted line) and publication times (solid line)" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more articles, fine-grained temporal trends emerge. The findings are consistent with the scraped data. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; appears to have made some recent improvement, but still is over 50 days from acceptance to&amp;nbsp;publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding acceptance time, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Medicine&lt;/em&gt; is an outlier, teetering around the 200 day mark. This finding is in line with my single experience with &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which consisted of poor communication and&amp;nbsp;delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt; has historically fared well compared to other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals both in acceptance and publication times. However, delays at &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt; have been relentlessly trending upwards. The focus on technical validity rather than article impact at &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt; likely contributes to quicker review and revision&amp;nbsp;periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="publication-and-acceptance-delays-for-plos-alternatives"&gt;Publication and acceptance delays for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I decided to compile recent delay information for as many journals as possible. I instructed my PubMed querier to retrieve records for all 1,572,538 publications since 2014. Of these articles, 667,773 had timestamps. PubMed data is not perfect. For example, 9,945 articles had anachronistic timestamps and were&amp;nbsp;omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at delays for open access journals in my field. Below, publication time distributions are shown for 16&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Publishing time per journal" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/publication-days-violinplot.png" title="Publication delays for 16 open access journals in my field" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; has the highest median publication time. Since all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals use the same editorial and typesetting system, the poor performance across the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; family is&amp;nbsp;unsurprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; is quickest with a majority of articles published within 3 days after acceptance. The comparison is skewed because &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; allows &lt;a href="http://elifesciences.org/content/early/recent"&gt;early access&lt;/a&gt; to a pre-formatted article &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;. However, early access provides many of the benefits of publication such as visibility and&amp;nbsp;citability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I looked at acceptance times for the same 16&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Acceptance time per journal" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/acceptance-days-violinplot.png" title="Acceptance delays for 16 open access journals in my field" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; is a clear winner with a median time of 74 days. The variation between journals for acceptance time is less drastic than for publication time: peer review sets a lower limit on the time needed for&amp;nbsp;acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="publication-and-acceptance-times-for-all-journals"&gt;Publication and acceptance times for all&amp;nbsp;journals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the median days till acceptance and publication for 3,482 journals. A journal may be omitted if it is not indexed by PubMed or had no timestamped articles since&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id="journals" class="display" cellspacing="0" width="100%"&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id="calling-for-a-journal-review-service"&gt;Calling for a journal review&amp;nbsp;service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptance and publication times are not the only factor to consider when selecting a journal. Traditionally, the impact factor &amp;#8212; average citations for articles published in the two preceding years &amp;#8212; has been a primary criteria. However, any single metric is insufficient to make an informed decision on where to submit. A host of other journal attributes matter such as readership, aesthetics, communication, friendliness, flexibility, features, and web&amp;nbsp;nativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose a journal review service. Like yelp for scientific publishing except that author reviews will be &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" title="Creative Commons — Attribution 4.0 International"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I see three main&amp;nbsp;benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency &amp;#8212; past author experiences with a journal are a treasure trove in need of a display&amp;nbsp;case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search &amp;#8212; even finding all journals that publish research in your field is difficult. A search feature would support filters and rankings based on user&amp;nbsp;preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progress &amp;#8212; journals can improve based on their feedback. If not, they will&amp;nbsp;perish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know in the comments if any services already exist to fulfill this&amp;nbsp;role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-conclusion"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal in performing this extensive evaluation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; publishing times was to bring light to an area of publishing that needed it. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; led the open access revolution and still has its unique advantages. Hopefully, public feedback will allow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; to improve in the areas where it&amp;nbsp;struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

This open science gathering will be held from November 14–16 in Brussels, Belgium. I have ordered my responses from practical to philosophical and mundane to&amp;nbsp;radical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I went to the Bay Area Open Access Week &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/blog/post/97879213303/save-the-date-participative-bay-area-oa-week-event-for-generation-open/" title="Participative Bay Area OA week event for Generation Open"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;. Here I met the founder of &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com" title="A community for real-time open collaborative science"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the open science platform I now use for my research. I had not heard of &lt;a href="http://opendataday.org/" title="International Open Data Hackathon"&gt;Open Data Day&lt;/a&gt; until now but look forward to attending a local hackathon on its next&amp;nbsp;occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="if-you-are-currently-engaged-in-activities-to-advance-open-access-open-education-andor-open-data-please-describe-them"&gt;If you are currently engaged in activities to advance Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data, please describe&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year began with a major leap. I embarked on a fully open research project. First, I posted our &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/proposal" title="Proposal: Repurposing drugs on a heterogeneous network"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8212; a platform that pays scientists to interact openly. We constantly revise the proposal based on feedback. All research is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science" title="Open notebook science"&gt;open notebook&lt;/a&gt;. And we post our analyses upon their&amp;nbsp;conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process has been a thrilling success. Currently &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/leaderboard" title="Thinklab leaderboard"&gt;16 contributors&lt;/a&gt; have provided feedback and assistance, earning an estimated $1,136 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; for their 59 comments. Our project has birthed &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/discussion" title="Project discussions"&gt;32 discussions&lt;/a&gt;, each one a citable work with a dedicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOI&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve made 350 public github &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel" title="Daniel Himmelstein's GitHub"&gt;contributions&lt;/a&gt; this year and published 23 project-related &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel?tab=repositories" title="Daniel Himmelstein's GitHub repositories"&gt;repositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take pleasure in sifting through data, extracting insights, and providing condensed user-friendly derivations. To this end, I have created several websites: a &lt;a href="http://het.io/disease-genes/browse/" title="hetio · Disease-associated gene browser"&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt; for my results, a &lt;a href="http://git.dhimmel.com/gene-ontology/" title="GO Annotations · User-friendly Gene Ontology Annotations"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; for sets of related genes, and an &lt;a href="http://git.dhimmel.com/SIDER2/" title="SIDER 2 Tutorial &amp;amp; Analysis"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of side effects extracted from drug&amp;nbsp;labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; marked the culmination of an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705" title="Lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation: evidence for oxygen as an inhaled carcinogen"&gt;independent study&lt;/a&gt; coauthored with &lt;a href="http://www.ksimeonov.com/" title="Kamen Simeonov Homepage"&gt;my roommate&lt;/a&gt;. Using only publicly-available data, we identified an association between lung cancer and elevation. The study &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/609054266645426176" title="PLOS article level metrics show increased interest in oxygen driven tumorigenesis"&gt;spurred interest&lt;/a&gt; in the topic and received lots of attention. It currently &lt;a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/3060395#score" title="Altmetric summary: score in context"&gt;ranks&lt;/a&gt; in the 99.9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of articles tracked by Altmetric. &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#questions" title="Lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation: Questions"&gt;question feature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/cruk-reassessment/" title="The Cancer Research UK Reassessment of our Lung Cancer versus Elevation Study"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; served as post-publication venues for further investigation. The study cost no money and illustrates how open data facilitates citizen&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While personally motivated by ideology, I know the move to openness must be driven by incentives. I hope to illustrate the benefits by example, but am also a hardened and vocal advocate. I am committed to &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" title="Creative Commons — Attribution 4.0 International"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" title="Creative Commons — CC0 1.0 Universal"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; licensing for my work. And when training new scientists, open science is a large part of my &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/himmelstein/biological-medical-informatics/36" title="Welcoming to incoming bioinformatics students at UCSF"&gt;curriculum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-your-interest-in-open-access-open-education-andor-open-data-and-how-does-it-relate-to-your-work"&gt;What is your interest in Open Access, Open Education and/or Open Data and how does it relate to your&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict new uses for existing drugs by mining the union of many diverse datasets. My project integrates over &lt;a href="http://thinklab.com/p/rephetio/proposal#metanodes" title="Table 1. Metanodes"&gt;20 public databases&lt;/a&gt; and depends on open source&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two consequences of open science attract me: hastening discovery and enabling anyone to be a&amp;nbsp;scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I yearn to see the reality behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave" title="Plato's Allegory of the Cave"&gt;shadows&lt;/a&gt;. Alone this is impossible; I will always remain a prisoner. But together, through the crossbreeding of our works, we can escape the&amp;nbsp;cave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants" title="Standing on the shoulders of giants"&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; from 1676 is no longer true. If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of dwarfs that &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; dwarf the&amp;nbsp;giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-would-you-use-your-experience-at-opencon-to-advance-open-access-open-education-andor-open-data"&gt;How would you use your experience at OpenCon to advance Open Access, Open Education and/or Open&amp;nbsp;Data?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our weapons are immaterial &amp;#8212; crowdsourced knowledge, open source, the public domain, and technical standards &amp;#8212; yet nonetheless require a coordinated&amp;nbsp;sharpening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central authority is antithetical to open science. The open scientist limits herself only by the bounds of possibility and heeds no artificial constraint. How then, without a ruler, does a decentralized community coordinate? Can an army of isolated heretics wage war on a unified front? The soldiers must be brought&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenCon 2015&lt;/em&gt; is that gathering. With an assembly of 163, 13,203 peer-to-peer interactions are possible. And which interactions occur will determine the future of&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="open science"></category><category term="open access"></category><category term="open data"></category><category term="Thinklab"></category><category term="conferences"></category><category term="applications"></category></entry><entry><title>The Cancer Research UK Reassessment of our Lung Cancer versus Elevation Study</title><link href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/cruk-reassessment/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-01-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Himmelstein</name></author><id>tag:blog.dhimmel.com,2015-01-15:cruk-reassessment/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank &lt;em&gt;Cancer Research &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for their cancer related advocacy and &lt;a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2015/01/14/does-oxygen-cause-lung-cancer-i-wouldnt-hold-your-breath/" title="Does oxygen cause lung cancer?"&gt;their coverage&lt;/a&gt; of our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705" title="Lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation"&gt;recent publication&lt;/a&gt;. However, we find several aspects of their interpretation&amp;nbsp;troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we find it unwise to discount our study because it analyzed counties rather than individuals. As &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.54.5.326" title="The ecological fallacy strikes back"&gt;Professor Pearce explains&lt;/a&gt;, much of our current understanding of cancer risk arose initially from &lt;strong&gt;ecological studies&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the key area in which epidemiologists have been able to &amp;#8220;add value&amp;#8221; has been through this population focus, although this lesson has been forgotten by many modern epidemiologists. For example, many of the recent discoveries on the causes of cancer (including dietary factors and colon cancer, hepatitis B and liver cancer, aflatoxins and liver cancer, human papilloma virus and cervical cancer) have their origins, directly or indirectly, in the systematic international comparisons of cancer incidence conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. These suggested hypotheses concerning the possible causes of the international patterns, which were investigated in more depth in further studies. In some instances these hypotheses were consistent with biological knowledge at the time, but in other instances they were new and striking, and might not have been proposed, or investigated further, if the population level analyses had not been&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to these influential studies of the past, our study benefitted from smaller population units (counties, not states as Ms. Osgun asserts), greater data availability, greater adjustment for potential confounding factors, and modern statistical techniques. Nonetheless, we view our findings as a starting point for further epidemiological and experimental research. In the meantime, we view oxygen-driven tumorigenesis as the most plausible explanation based on established knowledge regarding the underlying&amp;nbsp;biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of oxygen as a carcinogen is neither radical nor novel, as evidenced by the 1978 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; letter titled, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/274606a0" title="Are physiological oxygen concentrations mutagenic?"&gt;Are physiological oxygen concentrations mutagenic?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; (Hint: &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; rarely publishes negative results). Our study alone &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-2"&gt;cites&lt;/a&gt; over a dozen studies supporting oxygen&amp;#8217;s direct role in carcinogenesis. The evidence spans the spectrum from molecular to cellular to organismal and to clinical. Inspired molecular oxygen results in intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species, which lead to mutations. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019785" title="Ambient Oxygen Promotes Tumorigenesis"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; found mice that were predisposed to cancer took twice as long to develop tumors when housed in low-oxygen chambers. Finally, oxygen toxicity in the human lung is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.88.6.900" title="Pulmonary oxygen toxicity"&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2005.03.008" title="Childhood Cancer Following Neonatal Oxygen Supplementation"&gt;childhood cancer increases following neonatal oxygen supplementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;strong&gt;biological plausibility&lt;/strong&gt;, the criticism identifies four other characteristics of strong epidemiological evidence. We believe our study satisfies these&amp;nbsp;criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting for other factors&lt;/strong&gt;: For lung cancer, we included &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705/table-1" title="Table 1: Predictor information and inclusion."&gt;11 factors&lt;/a&gt; in addition to elevation to adjust for important demographic and cancer-risk factors. These factors include established risk factors (such as smoking, radon, and pollution), lifestyle variables (such as obesity, education, income, and race), and demographics (such as percent male and whether the county is metropolitan). We didn&amp;#8217;t include an age variable because our cancer rates were already age-adjusted to the 2000-census population. Furthermore, the inverse association persisted when we performed the analysis separately within each of the ten states, for males and females, and for those over and under 65 years of age. Since the causal factor appeared to affect every county, every state, both sexes, and all ages, pervasive environmental variables were the most likely confounders. Thus, we evaluated seven environmental variables such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UVB&lt;/span&gt; exposure, temperature, and precipitation. All seven alternative variables produced models over one billion times less likely than the elevation-including&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large numbers&lt;/strong&gt;: The probability of our observed association between lung cancer and elevation occurring by chance is less than one in a quadrillion. After filtering counties to only those with high-quality data, 253 counties remained for lung cancer. In the year 2000, these 253 counties had a combined population of 59,659,978, hardly a small&amp;nbsp;number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbiased&lt;/strong&gt;: We minimized potential biases from a variety of angles. Counties with high migration rates and Native American composition &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705/supp-1" title="Quality Control Filters"&gt;were filtered&lt;/a&gt;. Counties with populations below 10,000 &amp;#8212; whose measurements had greater margins of error &amp;#8212; were excluded, and the remaining counties were weighted by population in the analysis. Finally, we carefully selected the Western United States to minimize extraneous variation, which could cause bias, while capturing the variation in elevation of this mountainous&amp;nbsp;region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;: By definition, every breakthrough finding in science has yet to be reproduced upon discovery. We encourage replication on different regions and with different study designs. Our entire dataset, analysis pipeline, results, and codebase are public to make this task easier for&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criticism mentions the &lt;strong&gt;lag time&lt;/strong&gt; between exposure to cigarette smoke and lung cancer as a potential confounder and considers the recency of our smoking data as the &amp;#8220;likely&amp;#8221; culprit behind elevation&amp;#8217;s association with lung cancer. Let us destruct this argument using data. To assess the change in smoking, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-7954-12-5" title="Cigarette smoking prevalence in US counties: 1996-2012"&gt;we collected county smoking prevalences for 1996 and 2012&lt;/a&gt;. For the counties included in our lung cancer analysis, county smoking prevalence in 1996 was tightly linked to smoking prevalence in 2012 (first panel below). In other words, county smoking prevalences are relatively stable over time and were older smoking data available to us, the effect on our findings would likely be minimal. Next, we found that elevation was only &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; correlated with change in smoking rates over the 16 year period (second panel). For the lag time issue to present a serious omitted-variable bias, elevation and change in smoking would have to be &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; correlated. Finally, we evaluated the correlation between change in smoking and each of the 17 variables included in our lung cancer models. We found that six variables are more correlated with change in smoking than elevation (third panel). In other words, even if the lag time issue were capable of creating a spurious association between elevation and lung cancer, any of six variables we accounted for would prevent this&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The lag time between smoking exposure and cancer is unlikely to confound the elevation association." src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/cruk-reassessment/smoking-lagtime.png" title="Smoking Analysis" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to conclude by reiterating a few points from the paper. First, the elevation association was specific to lung cancer and did not extend to breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, providing evidence for an inhaled carcinogen. Second, the magnitude of the association was large, second only to smoking and responsible for a 12.7% decrease in lung cancer incidence for an 1000 meter rise. The likelihood of spurious associations, and especially ecological fallacy, decreases with effect size. Third, we performed extensive measures to avoid confounding, such as the &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-42"&gt;stratification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-45"&gt;subgrouping&lt;/a&gt; analyses, which Ms. Osgun fails to address. Finally, our publication is open access with a public peer review history, and we released our entire &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/elevcan" title="Project GitHub Repository"&gt;code, analysis, and results&lt;/a&gt;. We took these measures to allow independent verification and evidence-based data-driven reanalysis rather than&amp;nbsp;speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="findings"&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated whether cancer rates varied with altitude. Our primary focus was lung cancer, since the lung comes into direct contact with inhaled air and the level of atmospheric oxygen decreases with elevation. The same reactivity of oxygen that makes it an ideal input for respiration also risks causing cellular damage and mutation. Therefore, we evaluated whether inhaled oxygen is a human carcinogen by investigating the association between cancer and elevation. We analyzed ~250 counties in the Western United States, where the mountainous terrain results in varying elevations and high quality county data is&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that lung cancer decreased dramatically with rising elevation. This trend did not extend to breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer supporting our hypothesis that the elevation-dependent carcinogen is inhaled. The association between lung cancer and elevation remained after accounting for potential confounding factors, such as smoking, pollution, and obesity. Additionally, other environmental variables that could protect against lung cancer, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UVB&lt;/span&gt; exposure (an indicator of sunlight-induced vitamin D synthesis), were unable to replace the effect of&amp;nbsp;elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convey the magnitude of the observed association, we imagine a hypothetical situation where the entire United States elevates to the level of the highest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; county (San Juan, Colorado at 3,473 meters / 11,395 feet). Were all other factors to remain constant, we estimate 65,496 fewer new cases of lung cancer would arise per year. For comparison, 224,210 new cases of lung cancer &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21208" title="Cancer statistics, 2014"&gt;arose&lt;/a&gt; in the United States last&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don&amp;#8217;t recommend anyone relocate just yet and the risk for nonsmokers is low, experimental confirmation of oxygen-driven tumorgenesis could lead to new insights that yield better lung cancer preventions and treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Interact with this scatterplot to explore the relationship between elevation and lung cancer. The bivariate plot shows unadjusted lung cancer incidence decreasing with county elevation. The partial regression plot shows the relationship while accounting for additional factors, such as smoking and education. Accounting for the additional factors sharpened the association.

At its core, Facebook is a network (graph) of users (nodes) connected by friendships (edges). Each user exists and experiences content within the confines of their Facebook subgraph, the portion of the network consisting of their friends. When analyzed properly, an individual&amp;#8217;s friendship network paints a historical picture of his or her social&amp;nbsp;engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;#8217;ve created my Facebook friendship network. Nodes represents my friends, and edges represent their friendships. My network contains 1,278 friends with 40,255 friendships amongst themselves. Nearly all of my friends belong to the giant connected component displayed below. Node size indicates degree (number of mutual friends). I applied a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098679" title="ForceAtlas2 Publication - PLOS ONE"&gt;force-directed layout&lt;/a&gt; to organize the network: highly connected nodes are pulled together, while distantly connected nodes are&amp;nbsp;repulsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I would have manually categorized my friends into communities. However, to save time, I classified friends using a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/P10008" title="Fast unfolding of communities in large networks"&gt;community detection algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. The algorithm succeeded in partitioning my friends into communities (denoted by color) that coincided with my past social&amp;nbsp;experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Facebook Friendship Network" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/friendship-network/friendship-network.jpg" title="Facebook Friendship Network" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several interesting phenomena are revealed. The two largest clusters correspond to childhood and college, two highly social and prolonged eras of my life. My hometown friends formed two communities: those who graduated highschool in 2007 or before (purple) and those who graduated after 2007 (blue). My maternal kindred are tightly clustered forming their own community (dark green): my mom is one of sixteen siblings. My brother is the intermediate blue node between my hometown and kin clusters. I went to summer camp for nearly a decade in New Hampshire. These friends (light green community) are proximal but separate from my hometown friends. My 300-mile journey to a college full of new acquaintances manifests in a cluster distant from the rest of the network. At Cornell, I joined a fraternity as well as the debate team. However, only debate forms its own community reflecting the greater social isolation of that activity. Finally, my colleagues and classmates at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; are tightly clustered. The distant offshoot from this cluster represents the individuals I met while participating in a &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/imef-guatemala/" title="Innovation in Medical Education Forum"&gt;medical education forum in Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage my readers to play around with their own friendship networks. One interesting aspect is discovering the friends which bridge one&amp;#8217;s various communities. Additionally, unconnected nodes most commonly indicate serendipitous encounters or sockpuppet accounts. I used the &lt;a href="https://apps.facebook.com/netvizz/" title="Facebook netvizz App"&gt;netvizz app&lt;/a&gt; to extract my friendship network from Facebook and &lt;a href="https://gephi.github.io/" title="Gephi Homepage"&gt;Gephi&lt;/a&gt; for&amp;nbsp;visualization.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="networks"></category><category term="modules"></category><category term="facebook"></category><category term="friendship"></category><category term="social network analysis"></category><category term="graphs"></category><category term="netvizz"></category></entry><entry><title>Innovation in Medical Education Forum</title><link href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/imef-guatemala/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-11-19T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Himmelstein</name></author><id>tag:blog.dhimmel.com,2013-11-19:imef-guatemala/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the first week of October in 2013, I traveled to Guatemala. The &lt;a href="https://www.ufm.edu/index.php/Portal" title="Universidad Francisco Marroquin Homepage"&gt;Universidad Francisco Marroquín&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt;) hosted a &lt;a href="http://noticias.ufm.edu/index.php?title=Innovation_in_Medical_Education_Forum%2C_en_la_UFM" title="Innovation_in_Medical_Education_Forum%2C_en_la_UFM"&gt;forum of 30 innovators and medical professionals&lt;/a&gt; to envision the future of healthcare and medical education. The forum produced suggestions for a new medical degree, based on embracing disruptions, which would initially coexist with the current medical&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt; is well positioned to innovate education. Founded under free market ideals, the school is characterized by an entrepreneurial spirit and includes two business schools. As a private school without an endowment, tenured faculty, accreditation, or government funding, the school is optimized for&amp;nbsp;adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants included individuals supported by the &lt;a href="http://thielfoundation.org/" title="Thiel Foundation Homepage"&gt;Thiel Foundation&lt;/a&gt; as well as faculty from &lt;a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/" title="Harvard Medical School Homepage"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;, which offers student exchange with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several ideas came to the forefront as the forum&amp;nbsp;progressed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students should not complete a unit unless they have mastered the subject material. Variable learning rates are poorly accommodated by traditional academic&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development efforts should focus on the interactive portions of the curriculum. Consumption based learning can be outsourced. Open online courses provide world-class and cutting-edge education at little cost and enable coursework away from campus – for example, while providing care in the&amp;nbsp;countryside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctors should be just-in-time learners. Physicians need the ability to stay current in a rapidly changing field. The ability to effectively retrieve and integrate literature will be&amp;nbsp;crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology will continue to play a growing role in medicine eventually supplanting many of the current duties of a physician. Future physicians should be prepared to effectively embrace and explain these&amp;nbsp;technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients are costumers. Like any business, medicine should deliver services that the customer desires. Striving for customer satisfaction would help simplify the process of purchasing medical services and emphasize the often overlooked aspect of empathic&amp;nbsp;care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bioinformatics is an auspicious field given its low barriers to entry. Contracted bioinformatics projects could reduce tuition while providing an educational research experience for&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the &lt;a href="http://noticias.ufm.edu/index.php?title=Cientificos_y_emprendedores_en_la_UFM" title="Cientificos_y_emprendedores_en_la_UFM"&gt;opportunity to explore the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt; campus&lt;/a&gt; and was thoroughly impressed by the design, hospitality, principles, and foresight of the institution. While visiting the campus, I was interviewed about my views on accessibility and communication in science.
