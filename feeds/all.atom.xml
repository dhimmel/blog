OpenStreetMap is like Wikipedia but for maps: a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got in touch with &lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/ezekielf"&gt;Zeke&lt;/a&gt;, he wrote
&amp;#8220;I started contributing to OpenStreetMap in 2008 largely because good online trail maps were hard to come by at the time.&amp;#8221;
Due to the efforts of contributors like Zeke — most volunteers, exceeding 6 million in number —
OpenStreetMap has begun to rival, and often exceed, proprietary alternatives like Google&amp;nbsp;Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write this post to announce that &lt;strong&gt;the best map of the Long Trail is now freely available to anyone via OpenStreetMap&lt;/strong&gt;.
Curious where the oldest long-distance hiking trail in America wanders?
Look no further than &lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Entire Long Trail route exported from OpenStreetMap and superimposed on a terrain map." src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/long-trail-maps/2021-06-30_long-trail-stamen-terrain.png" title="Long Trail on Stamen Terrain Background. Screenshot from uMap."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-big-three"&gt;The Big&amp;nbsp;Three&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest in mapping the Long Trail began with my September 2020 southbound thru-hike.
As far as navigation options for hikers go, there are three main mapmakers:
Green Mountain Club, Guthook, and&amp;nbsp;OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="green-mountain-club"&gt;Green Mountain&amp;nbsp;Club&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.greenmountainclub.org/"&gt;Green Mountain Club&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMC&lt;/span&gt;) is the non-profit organization that maintains the Long Trail.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMC&lt;/span&gt; publishes a &lt;a href="https://store.greenmountainclub.org/collections/maps/products/preorder-now-long-trail-map-6th-edition-waterproof"&gt;paper Long Trail map&lt;/a&gt;,
last updated in 2021 and on its 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; edition.
The map is plastic-coated for water resistance and divided into 8 sections to minimize refolding.
It includes distances, major side trails, shelter locations, 100-feet contour lines, hill-shading, elevation profiles, and nearby towns at 1:85,000 scale.
If you like a physical map, then consider supporting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMC&lt;/span&gt;!
The map is listed at $12.95, and available from major retailers like
&lt;a href="https://www.rei.com/product/177869/green-mountain-club-vermonts-long-trail-map-5th-edition" title="Outdated 5th edition"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vermonts-Long-Trail-Green-Mountain/dp/1888021608/"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;,
and your local&amp;nbsp;outfitters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMC&lt;/span&gt; also releases a digital version of their map, &lt;a href="https://www.avenzamaps.com/maps/1250308"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; via the Avenza mobile App for $12.99.
With this map, you are essentially buying a georeferenced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; of the paper map.
This means you can use your phone&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; (which works in airplane mode) to superimpose your location on a static map.
But the PDFs are locked in the Avenza app, so make sure you like the Avenza interface before&amp;nbsp;purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="guthook-guides"&gt;Guthook&amp;nbsp;Guides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://atlasguides.com/"&gt;Guthook Guides&lt;/a&gt; brands itself &amp;#8220;the #1 app for long-distance hikes&amp;#8221;.
Currently, Guthook sells guides for 53 trails, including the &lt;a href="https://atlasguides.com/long-trail-map/"&gt;Long Trail&lt;/a&gt; for the price of $11.99.
The Guthook App includes the route and locations of shelters, campsites, water sources, and&amp;nbsp;viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real selling point however is the large number of user comments on points of interest (POIs).
The comments can help with scouting to optimize your hike,
but also can distract from the experience,
burn a hole in your battery pack,
and create reliance on an information source that isn&amp;#8217;t available for trails off the beaten&amp;nbsp;path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guthook is made by hikers for hikers.
But its database of routes and POIs is proprietary.
Leaving a comment or suggesting a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POI&lt;/span&gt; is sharing that information only with customers of Guthook,
rather than society at&amp;nbsp;large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="openstreetmap"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the proprietary Google or Apple Maps,
anyone is free to reuse and modify OpenStreetMap.
This has resulted in a diverse range of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8050232" title="Corporate Editors in the Evolving Landscape of OpenStreetMap"&gt;contributors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/about-osm-community/consumers/"&gt;consumers&lt;/a&gt;.
Tesla owners have added missing parking lots to improve their cars&amp;#8217; &lt;em&gt;Smart Summon&lt;/em&gt; autonomous parking feature.
Amazon &lt;a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/Amazon#searchInput"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; roadways and adds missing driveways to improve their delivery logistics.
The &lt;a href="https://www.hotosm.org/"&gt;Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team&lt;/a&gt; applies the map to assist with disaster response. 
Popular navigation apps like Strava and MapMyRide show their users maps derived from OpenStreetMap.
I&amp;#8217;ve even used it to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/1221841589661659138"&gt;navigate&lt;/a&gt; through&amp;nbsp;Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenStreetMap has a lot more than just &lt;em&gt;streets&lt;/em&gt;,
and contains natural features as well as those related to outdoor recreation,
such as trails, campsites, shelters, waterways, and cliffs.
Unlike the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMC&lt;/span&gt; map and Guthook, OpenStreetMap is not based around any single trail.
Nonetheless, it &lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/391736#map=9/43.9839/-72.4919"&gt;contains&lt;/a&gt; the entire Long Trail.
But since OpenStreetMap itself is just a geospatial database,
it is best paired with an outdoor navigation app that specialize in rendering&amp;nbsp;wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;

and &lt;a href="https://www.komoot.com/tour/403656220"&gt;Komoot&lt;/a&gt;.
All of these apps include data from OpenStreetMap in their default map rendering.
So by exporting the Long Trail to a route and uploading it to these apps,
we&amp;#8217;re essentially highlighting a trail that should already be on the map.
Many of these apps support downloading maps for offline use, but sometimes only as a paid&amp;nbsp;feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just want to look at the Long Trail route from OpenStreetMap quickly,
here&amp;#8217;s an embedded map &lt;a href="http://u.osmfr.org/m/506490/"&gt;from uMap&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- OpenStreetMap uMap Embed https://u.osmfr.org/m/506490/ --&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id="comparison"&gt;Comparison&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s how the three maps look on mobile.
With both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMC&lt;/span&gt;/Avenza and Guthook,
you&amp;#8217;re required to use their selected map as the background.
If you look closely at the Guthook screenshot,
you&amp;#8217;ll see the map is from Google.
For an OpenStreetMap-derived map,
we can use any of the options above.
Here, Gaia &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; is used with their dark mode&amp;nbsp;map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The big three Long Trail maps side-by-side: GMC via Avenza, Guthook Guides, and OpenStreetMap via Gaia GPS." src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/long-trail-maps/long-trail-maps-side-by-side.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked a landmark segment of the trail,
which passes over the Winooski River and under Interstate 89,
coinciding with the lowest elevation point along the hike.
One difference between the maps is that Guthook skips a part of the trail,
staying on Duxbury Road instead.
If you look at the comments on Guthook for the nearby trailhead,
many users note the new-and-true route.
This is a good example of how Guthook comments provide advanced reconnaissance,
but can diminish the experience should they spoil the surprise of a guard dog ambush or tempt you to &lt;a href="https://adventurepossible.com/adventure/white-blue-and-other-blazes-of-the-appalachian-trail/"&gt;yellow blaze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="my-hike"&gt;My&amp;nbsp;Hike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hiked the Long Trail in September, with my two friends Freshmeat and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;I.A.O.&lt;/span&gt; Moosalamoo (trail names).
September is an ideal month, since there are fewer bugs, less mud, and later sunrises.
But really any month is a good time to hike!
We hiked 280 miles over 12 days, 22 hours, and 42&amp;nbsp;minutes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- 310:42:45 according to ViewRanger recording --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;taking us from Canada to Massachusetts along the spine of the Green&amp;nbsp;Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to sum up the trip in three photos.
But I&amp;#8217;ll&amp;nbsp;try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail hits many of Vermont&amp;#8217;s most prominent ski areas,
including
Stratton (detour),
Bromley,
Killington (recommended detour),
Pico (detour),
Middlebury Snow bowl,
Sugarbush,
Mad River Glen,
Stowe,
Smuggler&amp;#8217;s Notch,
and Jay Peak.
Here Freshmeat enjoys the morning fog on Lift 2 of Mad River&amp;nbsp;Glen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sitting on the top chair of Lift 2 at Mad River Glen in the Fog." src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/long-trail-maps/2020-09-18_ski-lift-in-the-fog.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a grueling day that started in Johnson and ended at the Taft Lodge on Mount Mansfield, I prepared a deluxe feast for&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Preparing a meal at Taft Lodge." src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/long-trail-maps/2020-09-15_meal.jpg" title="Dirtbag deluxe aka the hiker trash feast."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we were rewarded by an unremarkable, windy, and solitary sunrise on Vermont&amp;#8217;s highest peak.
There were some incredible beaver dams along the path,
including the one that created this pond where we stayed on our last night (see also the &lt;a href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/long-trail-maps/2020-09-25_tree-at-night-astrophotography.jpg"&gt;astrophotography version&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4110572447"&gt;2020-09-25 Long Trail&amp;nbsp;Finale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="editing-the-map"&gt;Editing the&amp;nbsp;Map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/long-trail-maps/blob/dhimmel-changesets/supplements/2020-10-01_National_Forest_System_Trails.xlsx"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Forest Service, the Long Trail is #1 (or perhaps #3).
But according to OpenStreetMap, it&amp;#8217;s 391736.
That is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/391736#map=9/43.8137/-72.9231"&gt;Long Trail &lt;em&gt;relation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
The relation connects all the individual trail segments (called ways) into a single conceptual&amp;nbsp;unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned Zeke Farwell completing the Long Trail,
I was referring to the relation which created a continuous path the length of Vermont.
Zeke described a bit more about his early work on the Long&amp;nbsp;Trail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imported most of the trail from a publicly available government data source so it would have been “complete” from end to end right away.
This imported trail was better than nothing,
but not very accurate so for the next few years I refined it from my own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; traces, aerial imagery, or any other data sources I came&amp;nbsp;across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to complete the trail physically in 2012.
Eight years later, when I hiked the trail with a copy of the OpenStreetMap relation loaded into my navigation app,
I noticed some portions of the trail were off.
And many side trails were missing.
Many of the trails still followed Zeke&amp;#8217;s original imports,
and hadn&amp;#8217;t yet benefitted from a decade of increased data and improved &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set out to revise the entire Long Trail.
Over a third of the Long Trail is shared with the Appalachian Trail.
I expected the Appalachian Trail portion to be more accurate due to its significance,
but this was not the&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I based my mapping primarily on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; tracks.
First I had my own track from our thru-hike,
and second I could reference the &lt;a href="https://www.strava.com/heatmap"&gt;Strava heatmap&lt;/a&gt;,
which summarizes all tracks uploaded to that platform over the past two&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the online iD editor for all of my edits
(except for rearranging the relation members which I had to do with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JOSM&lt;/span&gt;).
Here is an in-progress edit of the summit of Stratton Mountain.
The dashed lines show the trails in OpenStreetMap.
The red/orange/yellow heatmap shows the tracks of Strava users.
The pink line is my&amp;nbsp;track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenStreetMap iD editor zoomed into the Long Trail on Stratton Mountain." src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/long-trail-maps/2020-09-29_osm-iD-editor-stratton-mountain.png" title="Editing OpenStreetMap on 2020-09-29 using the iD editor with a Strava Heatmap background. The red line shows the track of our hike. GPS tracks indicate the Long Trail is incorrectly placed."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; recording from consumer hardware will have some inaccuracy,
but this is easily overcome by averaging many tracks!
Wisdom of the crowd.
My track as well as the Strava heatmap make it clear that the Long Trail needs to be shifted east, along with some other alignments.
I made these changes in &lt;a href="https://overpass-api.de/achavi/?changeset=91733004"&gt;changeset 91733004&lt;/a&gt;,
where I also added additional metadata to the fire tower like that its height is 21 meters.
Maybe now the tower will &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/flight-simulator-open-street-map-building-205545509.html" title="A typo created a 212-story monolith in ‘Microsoft Flight Simulator’"&gt;show up&lt;/a&gt; in flight simulators.
By the way, if you like fire towers, the Long Trail has three:
&lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5129580921"&gt;Glastenbury&lt;/a&gt;,

I started the edits the day after getting back from the hike,
and completed my revisions in 11 days, faster even than we hiked it!
Warning before you start contributing to OpenStreetMaps,
it can be&amp;nbsp;addicting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added many of the shelters that were missing,
such as the &lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/852564406#map=19/44.39119/-72.91795"&gt;Duck Brook Shelter&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;Old Long Trail&lt;/em&gt; that&amp;#8217;s visible in the map comparison image above.
One type of feature that is still largely missing is privies.
While all the shelters have a privy nearby,
it can be surprisingly hard to find them, especially at night.
Here&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/8756516442"&gt;a privy&lt;/a&gt; at Battell Shelter &lt;a href="https://overpass-api.de/achavi/?changeset=105147881"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; recently by user &lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/dchiles"&gt;dchiles&lt;/a&gt;.
How is this coded in the database?
It is just a point (node) that has the following&amp;nbsp;tags:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;tag&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access?uselang=en" title="The wiki description page for the access tag"&gt;access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:amenity?uselang=en" title="The wiki description page for the amenity tag"&gt;amenity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;composting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;toilets:disposal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;pitlatrine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;toilets:handwashing&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added&amp;nbsp;the &lt;code&gt;composting=yes&lt;/code&gt; tag to help raise awareness of proper &lt;a href="https://www.greenmountainclub.org/privy-privy-privy/"&gt;privy etiquette&lt;/a&gt;:
no trash, only toilet paper and poo, unless it&amp;#8217;s a moldering privy in which case urine is&amp;nbsp;welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the interactive map above, there is a &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; layer you can toggle on, which will show the Long Trail route before my edits.
While only a few sections deviated in major ways, I realigned large portions of the trial.
Looking at features (specifically nodes, ways, and relations) that were &lt;a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/18VX"&gt;last edited by me&lt;/a&gt;,
you&amp;#8217;ll notice a pattern in my contributions spanning the Long Trail (along with the Upper Valley, see also &lt;a href="https://yosmhm.neis-one.org/?zoom=9&amp;amp;lat=43.89078&amp;amp;lon=-71.98882&amp;amp;layers=B00TTF&amp;amp;u=dhimmel"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOSMHM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you see the section in the middle &amp;#8212; in Green Mountain National Forest &amp;#8212; where I don&amp;#8217;t have any of the most recent edits?
That is because another user &lt;a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Adam%20Franco"&gt;Adam Franco&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;a href="https://overpass-api.de/achavi/?changeset=103664322"&gt;further enhancements&lt;/a&gt; more&amp;nbsp;recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the beauty of OpenStreetMap.
It is a living map,
whose model of open licensing and crowdsourced contribution give rise to a map more complete and encompassing than any proprietary&amp;nbsp;alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberate the trails, put them on &lt;em&gt;the map&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Message from Zeke: https://www.openstreetmap.org/messages/894718

&gt; Congrats on the thru-hike! I also hiked the LT in 2012. I’m having a hard time remembering exactly when I started working on the long trail in OSM, but I believe it was one of the earliest things I did. I started contributing to OSM in 2008 largely because good online trail maps were hard to come by at the time. I added trails in Vermont because that is where I live and like to hike. The Long Trail is the longest and most well known hiking trail in Vermont so it made sense to get that into OSM. I’m pretty sure I added it in my first year or two working on OSM. The ways making up the trail probably predate the relation because the idea of a relation data structure was either still very new to OSM or didn’t exist yet. If I remember correctly, I imported most of the trail from a publicly available government data source so it would have been “complete” from end to end right away. This imported trail was better than nothing, but not very accurate so for the next few years I refined it from my own GPS traces, aerial imagery, or any other data sources I came across. I haven’t payed too much attention in recent years, but I’m sure there are still plenty areas that need improvement. I did revisit the area around the Winooski River bridge after that was built and the trail rerouted in that area.

While selected to a final shortlist, she did not win. Dr. Kane has nominated Elbakyan a second time for 2020 and named me as a reference after reading &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32822" title="Sci-Hub provides access to nearly all scholarly literature. eLife (2018-03-01)"&gt;our study&lt;/a&gt; on the coverage of Sci-Hub&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;catalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a figure where we &lt;a href="https://greenelab.github.io/scihub-manuscript/#fig:downloads"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; the growth in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; downloads from Sci-Hub over time, based on server log data that Elbakyan has made&amp;nbsp;public:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sci-Hub Downloads per Day (including Elsevier DOIs that were missing from an earlier dataset)" src="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub/raw/850f4c69828959249f1bcb605e78192a8c8087f4/download/scihub-logs-2017/scihub-log-downloads.svg?sanitize=true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sci-Hub&amp;#8217;s growth reflects the urgent need of scholars to access the literature. As a proponent of a more open future for science, it is my honor to recommend Elbakyan for the Maddox&amp;nbsp;Prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reference-letter"&gt;Reference&amp;nbsp;Letter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Alexandra Elbakyan unveiled her tool Sci-Hub for providing fulltext access to scholarly articles, especially articles that are paywalled by their publishers. The service was available at sci-hub.org until 2015, when publishing giant Elsevier was able to shut down Sci-Hub&amp;#8217;s .org domain with an uncontested lawsuit in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; court&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following years, Sci-Hub adopted additional domains including .bz, .cc, .cn, .cool, .fun, .ga, .gq, .hk, .io, .is, .la, .mn, .mu, .name, .nu, .nz, .ooo, .shop, .tv, .wang, and .ws. All of these domains are now defunct. Yet Sci-Hub persevered, and, as I write, is available at &lt;a href="https://sci-hub.st"&gt;https://sci-hub.st&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sci-hub.se"&gt;.se&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sci-hub.tw"&gt;.tw&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://sci-hub.ee"&gt;.ee&lt;/a&gt;. I begin with this list of censored domains as a testament to the opposition Sci-Hub has&amp;nbsp;encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opposition should come as no surprise. Sci-Hub challenges the subscription publishing business model that &lt;a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/2018_10_04_STM_Report_2018.pdf" title="The STM Report: An overview of scientific and scholarly publishing. Fifth edition, October 2018"&gt;brings in&lt;/a&gt; over $10 billion &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; in revenue annually from toll access scholarly journals. Communicating science is of critical importance. Yet we inherited a publishing system whose design impedes access and reuse. Paywalling publicly funded research is unacceptable, especially since the proceeds don&amp;#8217;t fund the research or reward the creators (authors, peer reviewers, and&amp;nbsp;editors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elbakyan recognizes the injustice of the current system, writing on the Sci-Hub&amp;nbsp;homepage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fight inequality in knowledge access across the world. The scientific knowledge should be available for every person regardless of their income, social status, [and] geographical&amp;nbsp;location&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all research stakeholders benefit from open access. Scholars want to disseminate their ideas. Funders want a societal return on their investment. Readers want access and the right to view research on any platform. Text miners want to accelerate the pace of discovery by using machines to extract insights from the&amp;nbsp;literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were authors, funders, and institutions to decide that all future publications must be open, toll access journals would have no choice but to switch. Sadly, the scholarly community has been too indecisive and laggard. Ultimately, culpability lies with authors who sign copyright transfer agreements, ceding society&amp;#8217;s ability to access and reuse materials the public has funded. Were more scientists willing to take personal action to end the antiquated toll access system, there would be no need for Sci-Hub. But this has not been the case, and Sci-Hub, led by Elbakyan, has taken on the challenge of making sure all humans have access to the scientific record, while promoting an open&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As libraries &lt;a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-cancellation-tracking/" title="Big Deal Cancellation Tracking"&gt;continue to cancel&lt;/a&gt; major journal subscriptions, we owe Elbakyan immense gratitude. In a decade from now, we will likely witness the vast majority of articles published openly. While initiatives like Plan S and preprints are playing a role, they are &lt;a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/04/16/researcher-to-reader-r2r-debate-is-sci-hub-good-or-bad-for-scholarly-communication/" title="Researcher to Reader (R2R) Debate: Is Sci-Hub Good or Bad for Scholarly Communication?"&gt;secondary to Sci-Hub&lt;/a&gt;. Elbakyan sees her contribution in making open access inevitable, &lt;a href="https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/why-sci-hub-is-the-true-solution-for-open-access-reply-to-criticism/" title="Why Sci-Hub is the true solution for Open Access: reply to criticism"&gt;explaining&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of long-term operation of Sci-Hub will be that publishers change their publishing models to support Open Access, because closed access will make no sense&amp;nbsp;anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove this point, I led a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32822" title="Sci-Hub provides access to nearly all scholarly literature. eLife (2018-03-01)"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; that found Sci-Hub already contained 85% of articles in toll access&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elbakyan has made personal sacrifices for her cause. According to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; courts, she owes $15 million to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355308/87/elsevier-inc-v-sci-hub/" title="Elsevier Inc. v. Sci-Hub. Default Judgment — Document #87"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt; and $4.8 million to the &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6146630/36/american-chemical-society-v-does-1-99/" title="American Chemical Society v. Does 1-99. Order on Motion for Default Judgment — Document #36"&gt;American Chemical Society&lt;/a&gt; for copyright infringement. To highlight the absurdity of this punishment, the court fined Elbakyan $150,000 per article, since Elsevier&amp;#8217;s suit specifically alleged infringement of 100 articles (&lt;a href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub/issues/39"&gt;including one&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.K.&lt;/span&gt; government work that legally belongs in the public domain). Based outside of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; jurisdiction, Elbakyan did not file a legal defense against these suits, although she did write a &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355308/50/elsevier-inc-v-sci-hub/"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to the&amp;nbsp;judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detractors &lt;a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/09/18/guest-post-think-sci-hub-is-just-downloading-pdfs-think-again/"&gt;accuse&lt;/a&gt; Elbakyan of being a malicious cyber criminal. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Justice Department even &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-department-investigates-sci-hub-founder-on-suspicion-of-working-for-russian-intelligence/2019/12/19/9dbcb6e6-2277-11ea-a153-dce4b94e4249_story.html"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; her for ties to Russian intelligence. But there is no public evidence to support the conclusion that Sci-Hub has any other objective than universal access to research. And the operation appears to be funded primarily by donations and volunteer&amp;nbsp;effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elbakyan has remained steadfast in the face of these smear campaigns and legal challenges. She engages the public via her &lt;a href="https://engineuring.wordpress.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://vk.com/sci_hub"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and comments to the media. Of course, she must maintain a high level of privacy and restrict public appearances given the controversial nature of her work. But Sci-Hub speaks for itself. Calling Sci-Hub the &amp;#8220;only solution available to access articles [for many researchers]&amp;#8221;, Elbakyan &lt;a href="https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/why-sci-hub-is-the-true-solution-for-open-access-reply-to-criticism/"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What differentiates Sci-Hub from this talk, is that Sci-Hub not talking, but actually solving this problem, providing access to those researchers who need&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting June 15, 2019, I hiked from Skógar to Leirubakki in Iceland. My five day trek covered the following connected&amp;nbsp;trails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting June 15, 2019, I hiked from Skógar to Leirubakki in Iceland. My five day trek covered the following connected&amp;nbsp;trails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike totaled 167 kilometers (104 miles, &lt;a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/MTA5MTgwODA="&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; track&lt;/a&gt;) across many highlights of the Southern Icelandic&amp;nbsp;wilderness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ViewRanger GPS Track: 2019-06-15 Skogar to Leirubakki in Iceland" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/01-viewranger-gps-track.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Iceland is home to many &lt;a href="https://www.kimkim.com/c/the-best-multi-day-hikes-in-iceland"&gt;multi-day hikes&lt;/a&gt;, I chose this Southern excursion due to its accessible logistics and the recommendations of my trusted counsel: Hayden the nomadic giant; Tómas the native, Andersen the nice; and Jake the ultralight&amp;nbsp;introvert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I would learn along the way, my path traversed Iceland&amp;#8217;s longest continuous marked hiking trail system. Please comment if this assertion is incorrect or if it is possible to extend this trek&amp;nbsp;further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hiked northbound for additional flexibility, since it provided more potential exit points while ensuring I covered the two most popular segments: the Fimmvörðuháls and Laugavegur trails. While these trails were magnificent, they were also crowded. So if you seek solitude in nature and more opportunities for wild camping, consider the Hellismannaleið trail and its&amp;nbsp;extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icelandic names take a bit of repetition and practice to get used to. This picture of bus routes may be somewhat helpful in seeing how the destinations I mention are&amp;nbsp;oriented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Trex.is Bus Route Map" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/02-trexis-bus-route-map.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began in Skógar near the Southern coast. Going into the hike, I expected the named villages along the route to be towns. However, in general they were a couple buildings, usually belonging to a single seasonal establishment. Since mid June is early in the season, with substantial snowpack in many areas, several of the villages were still dormant. Hence, it&amp;#8217;s best to carry everything you need and expect little infrastructure along the&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fimmvoruhals-trail"&gt;Fimmvörðuháls&amp;nbsp;Trail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met several other hikers on the bus from Reykjavík to Skógar. We posed for a quick picture before setting&amp;nbsp;off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first day, I hiked with a French medic (black fleece above). At one point, he asked whether we should take a break to eat, to which I replied, &amp;#8220;I already ate.&amp;#8221; The wonders of multitasking while&amp;nbsp;walking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscapes were&amp;nbsp;expansive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fimmvörðuháls Trail marker" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/04-fimmvorduhals-trail-marker.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water, rocks, snow, vegetation, and clouds formed compositions of earthen&amp;nbsp;colors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="waterfall" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/05-waterfall.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At altitude, the mist and snow merged into a ghostly&amp;nbsp;gray:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rocks snow in the cloud" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/06-rocks-snow-in-cloud.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way down, the tectonic textures did not&amp;nbsp;disappoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="hillslope jigsaw" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/07-hillslope-jigsaw.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rock formation appeared deceivingly&amp;nbsp;anthropomorphic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rock formation" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/08-rock-formation.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, the Frenchman and I camped at the Básar campground in Þórsmörk. With a nice forest canopy and valley basin to shelter us from the ever-present elements of light and wind, I entered a deep and sustained&amp;nbsp;slumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the only night where sleep was pleasant. Perhaps the greatest battle going forward was the dreaded night where no amount of exhaustion, melatonin, or earplugs could overcome the forces of restlessness in these everlit arctic&amp;nbsp;borderlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="laugavegur-trail"&gt;Laugavegur&amp;nbsp;Trail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning I set out alone, as I would be for the remainder of the&amp;nbsp;hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Laugavegur trail sign" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/09-laugavegur-trail-sign.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early in the day, I crossed a stream with my shoes on, for convenience not necessity. Wet sneakers pushed me close to my blister threshold, and for the remainder of the hike I applied maximum blister prevention, consisting of taping hotspots with Leukotape P, crossing streams barefoot or circumnavigating them, and wearing Injinji toe socks as a&amp;nbsp;liner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, I crossed the behemoth Bláfjallakvísl river&amp;nbsp;barefoot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Big Stream Crossing" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/10-big-stream-crossing.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A warden I met afterwards said this is the one water crossing where he recommends footwear. It is also a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/44vcCQr6V88"&gt;road crossing&lt;/a&gt; and is wide. The frigidity rushed me forward against the competing objective of carefully selecting my&amp;nbsp;footing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some unfiltered water was more delicious than&amp;nbsp;others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Water Refill" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/11-water-refill.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great valley carved by rushing water revealed a red underbelly to the green&amp;nbsp;surface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="red in cliffside" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/12-red-in-cliffside.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snow had&amp;nbsp;horns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="snow horns" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/13-snow-horns.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was rumored that camping outside of established campgrounds, which charge fees if in operation, is prohibited on the Laugavegur trail. However, after 20 plus miles on the day, I arrived to the Álftavatn huts next to an alpine lake of the same name. I was shocked by the location of the campsites, which seemed to be directly in the line of fire of the fierce winds accelerating from over the&amp;nbsp;lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I continued on and slept (or attempted to) aside a large boulder a bit off the&amp;nbsp;trail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Offtrail Campsite" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/14-offtrail-campsite.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature would punish me for my possibly prohibited cowboy camping. By time I gave up on sleeping around 4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;, my quilt was dripping with condensation. Apparently, my intuition that clear skies would mean little dew was&amp;nbsp;incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add insult to injury, not more than 20 minutes into hiking, I encountered a rugged stream crossing. Have I mentioned that Iceland is cold, especially when the sun makes its brief dip below the&amp;nbsp;horizon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the top of the pass, I was rewarded with a steam&amp;nbsp;shadow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Steam shadow" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/15-steam-shadow.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as a more traditional&amp;nbsp;shadow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Panoramic Shaddow" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/16-panoramic-shadow.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long stretches of snowpack allowed for optimized routing and smooth&amp;nbsp;sailing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Snow passage" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/17-snow-passage.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the snow was most compact and responsive when off the beaten path. Post-holing ⁠— a term some hikers use for when their feet sink into the snow ⁠— was&amp;nbsp;non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the recommendation of a warden at the Hrafntinnusker hut, I ventured off the Laugavegur to a nearby ice cave that had collapsed, taking with it a German explorer — a tragic reminder of the drastic ephemerality of Iceland&amp;#8217;s volcanic&amp;nbsp;landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trek from the hut to the ice cave was a nice opportunity to escape the crowds, practice my skiing (without skis), and catch some&amp;nbsp;views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="View from the Hrafntinnusker ice cave" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/18-hrafntinnusker-ice-cave-view.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem was that I didn&amp;#8217;t see the ice cave ahead … until I turned around and&amp;nbsp;witnessed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Collapsed Ice cave at Hrafntinnusker" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/19-collapsed-ice-cave-hrafntinnusker.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a guess on what topographical features give rise to such a&amp;nbsp;sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued on to Landmannalaugar. The early start that morning paid off as a prolonged rain began as I neared camp. If you are looking to combine the Laugavegur and Hellismannaleið trails, check out the route I took through the Laugahraun lava field to avoid duplicating trail. This section never ceased to&amp;nbsp;amaze:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Laugahraun lava field bird" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/20-laugahraun-lava-field-bird.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Landmannalaugar, I setup up my tent at the most protected site I could find, which the many other campers seemed to have&amp;nbsp;overlooked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landmannalaugar tent setup" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/21-landmannalaugar-tent-setup.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recuperated in the hot springs, enjoying the juxtaposition of cold rain and geothermal&amp;nbsp;bath:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landmannalaugar Hot Springs" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/22-landmannalaugar-hot-springs.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not a problem for the day-tourists that arrive by the bus load, those who pass through Landmannalaugar on foot may want to avoid unnecessarily wetting their limited wardrobe. When I asked the women at the information office whether it was acceptable to enter the hot springs nude, she replied, &amp;#8220;Of course, this is&amp;nbsp;Iceland.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hellismannalei-trail"&gt;Hellismannaleið&amp;nbsp;Trail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling refreshed, sporting two pairs of surprisingly dry socks, I embarked on the Hellismannaleið trail to Rjúpnavellir. The morning started by crossing a stream-ridden valley before hiking out over the mountains in the&amp;nbsp;distance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Starting the Hellismannaleið" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/23-starting-hellismannaleid.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I successfully hopped over most of the streams … until I failed, soaking my shoes. At least I could just walk right through the remaining valley streams with my shoes on. Later I would discover a new trick for hopping streams: temporarily extending my trekking poles to max height and swinging over the&amp;nbsp;crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit later, nature gifted me with a bridge of&amp;nbsp;sorts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Natural bridge" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/24-natural-bridge.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the previous trails where hikers were plentiful, I would only see a single couple for the entirety of my time on the Hellismannaleið. Judge for yourself, but the beauty of this trail is distinct and unsurpassed by the Fimmvörðuháls and Laugavegur trails. Meanwhile, there were none of the sights that make Jake mad, like foam sleeping pads still in their plastic shrinkwrap and backpacks with rain covers on a sunny&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A took a liking to a lost beanie that I picked up earlier in the&amp;nbsp;hike:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Beanie" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/25-beanie.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also notice the water bottle clip on my shoulder strap, which I was sporting for the first time. I became a big fan … once I performed substantial aftermarket modifications (i.e. superglue) to the velcro attachment&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No complaining about a stream crossing when it&amp;#8217;s this&amp;nbsp;tranquil:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stream crossing Hellismannaleið" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/26-stream-crossing-hellismannaleid.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscapes transitioned to&amp;nbsp;desert:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Desert depression" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/27-desert-depression.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind was at my back, and I was covering more miles in a day than I ever had before. If the wind direction is consistent, this is a big benefit to the Landmannalaugar to Rjúpnavellir&amp;nbsp;orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold, Hekla, one of Iceland&amp;#8217;s most active volcanoes, having last erupted in&amp;nbsp;2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hekla" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/28-hekla.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of the hike, Hekla would remain as a frequent site. In many ways, Hellismannaleið and its extended versions are a homage to&amp;nbsp;Hekla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived to Áfangagil, which had not yet opened for the season, but did have running water and an unlocked&amp;nbsp;outhouse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Áfangagil trail sign" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/29-afangagil-trail-sign.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail signs matched the style of trail markers on the Hellismannaleið: white-tipped posts in the&amp;nbsp;ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground at Áfangagil was uneven, and only one tight spot seemed to offer wind&amp;nbsp;protection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Áfangagil tent site behind outhouse" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/30-afangagil-tent-site.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp volcanic rock below made me wish I had brought my polycro groundsheet to protect my Dyneema Composite Fabric bathtub floor. In retrospect, I should have left the thinlight pad at home and brought the polycro&amp;nbsp;instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arid scenes of endless gravel changed abrutly, as a stream emerged from&amp;nbsp;nowhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stream from nowhere" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/31-stream-from-nowhere.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some electronic instruments, perhaps to measure siesmic activity? The stream provided a prolonged oasis, replete with plant life, fish, and&amp;nbsp;waterfalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Waterfalls" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/32-waterfalls.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw the endless fields of lupine (&lt;em&gt;Lupinus nootkatensis&lt;/em&gt;), my world turned upside&amp;nbsp;down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lupine, Lupinus nootkatensis" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/33-lupine-lupinus-nootkatensis.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purple as far as the eye could see. I would later learn lupine is non-native species to Iceland, with locals having &lt;a href="https://www.hakaimagazine.com/features/why-iceland-is-turning-purple/"&gt;mixed opinions&lt;/a&gt; about this foreign&amp;nbsp;invader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hellismannalei-trail-extension"&gt;Hellismannaleið Trail&amp;nbsp;Extension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived to Rjúpnavellir around 10:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;. The online &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; route I was using for the Hellismannaleið Trail ended here. My bus was scheduled to stop at Leirubakki, a bit down the road, at 7:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;. I was planning on either road walking or&amp;nbsp;hitch-hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to my surprise, the trail signs indicated that I had not yet completed the Hellismannaleið&amp;nbsp;Trail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rjúpnavellir sign shows trail continue" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/34-rjupnavellir-trail-continues.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail goes on! Another 25 kilometers to Leirubakki! So not only did I have some extra time on my hands, but the Hellismannaleið trail seemed to continue in a circuitous route to my pickup spot. I had to&amp;nbsp;continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I grabbed a beer at Rjúpnavellir for under $2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;. While Iceland is generally quite expensive, Rjúpnavellir was the exception. Another customer came to recharge his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RV&lt;/span&gt; while napping… they charged him 500 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISK&lt;/span&gt;, which is the same price Básar charged me to briefly charge my external phone battery three days earlier. Wifi was free, and I began preloading the maps for the&amp;nbsp;extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff was helpful. While the boss was aware of the trail to Leirubakki, he had only done the first section to a waterfall. However, he claimed that I was on the longest marked trail in Iceland, and I certainly did not want to stop&amp;nbsp;short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set off. It quickly became apparent that the footpath for the trail had become quite overgrown (if it ever existed at all). However, hundreds of white-tipped posts were dutifully spaced and placed to mark the trail. Nonetheless, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t suggest embarking on this trail without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiking at a hurried pace as to not miss the bus, I reached the&amp;nbsp;waterfall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="dirty waterfall on Hellismannaleið Trail extension" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/35-waterfall-hellismannaleid-extension.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a long stretch of bushwacking through waist-high brush. Having learned of the lupine invasion, I trampled as many as possible (to little&amp;nbsp;effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail eventually joined with a dirt road, which seemed to be frequented by horseback. The road passed by a quaint turf&amp;nbsp;house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="turf house" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/36-turf-house.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later the trail diverged from the dirt road. Here&amp;#8217;s what the trail markers looked&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="trail marker" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/37-trail-marker.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavy infrastructure was generally in good shape, including a bridge and several ladders over&amp;nbsp;fences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ladder over fence" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/38-ladder-over-fence.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the land, especially near the end, seemed to have been used for grazing somewhat recently. I left many&amp;nbsp;footprints: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="footprint" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/39-footprint.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by time you arrive, my footprints will have blown away. Finally, I reached Leirubakki, the&amp;nbsp;end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="selfie at real end" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/40-selfie-at-real-end.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the sign clearly indicates that the Hellismannaleið trail starts here. But since other resources show Rjúpnavellir as the terminus, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to refer to this portion as the&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;extension&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With still a bit more time until the bus arrived, I visited the Hekla Center located in Leirubakki. In case you were wondering what to do if Hekla erupts, I took a picture of one of the&amp;nbsp;exhibits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="writing on the wall of the Hekla Visitor Center museum" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/41-hekla-visitor-center-exhibit.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gear"&gt;Gear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting together my &lt;a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/pzft6"&gt;gear list&lt;/a&gt; for this trip was a fun challenge. Before the hike, I gave a &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/344998904"&gt;professional presentation&lt;/a&gt; in London. Therefore, my gear list contains a section of travel/business-related gear that I left at the &lt;a href="https://www.reykjavikcampsite.is/"&gt;Reykjavík Campsite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d advise hikers to be well prepared against the cold, wind, and rain. I hiked several days in shorts, but having lightweight leg and arm covering can help protect against flies (big buzzing flies, not mosquitos) and the sun. I always hike with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; and maps on my phone, but this was especially improtant for the Hellismannaleið trail (&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;extension).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father often makes gear recommendations that deviate from the ultralight philosophy, such as wearing heavy hiking boots and bringing extra pairs of clothing. I disregarded this advice. He did however recommend one item I am glad I brought: the snow baskets for my trekking&amp;nbsp;poles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was flying, with no checked bags, I made sure not to take anything that would be problematic for the airport scanners. The &lt;strong&gt;carbon fiber&lt;/strong&gt; tent stakes and decomposable trekking poles passed through security four times. I used my &lt;a href="https://www.traildesigns.com"&gt;Trail Designs&lt;/a&gt; titanium wind screen with Esbit&amp;nbsp;fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was flying through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, I couldn&amp;#8217;t bring any food containing meat, dairy, or potatoes. I sure was sick of nuts by the end. Many of the huts did have hiker boxes, where I picked up some basic dehydrated&amp;nbsp;meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t bring a headlight or water filter, based on Tómas&amp;#8217; advice. However, a few water treatment tablets (repackaged into a plastic pen casing, of course) would have been nice for some water sources located downstream of grazing grounds or other fecal matter of unknown&amp;nbsp;origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an amazing trek. If you&amp;#8217;re seeking a longer hike than the usual Fimmvörðuháls and Laugavegur trails, consider adding on the Hellismannaleið. If you&amp;#8217;re feeling adventurous and are of a completionary temperament go all the way to/from Leirubakki as opposed to&amp;nbsp;Rjúpnavellir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland is an amazing natural resource. Help maintain it on the trail by picking up any litter. Hiking is a great way to enjoy Iceland while avoiding many of the more costly and thus environmentally destructive forms of&amp;nbsp;tourism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iceland&amp;#8217;s beauty comes with risk, so please make sure to prepare sufficiently. Plan for rugged conditions. I got lucky with the weather, so make sure you have backup plans should your pace be slower than expected. Note that most common itineraries for these trails take approximately double the days (i.e. 9 days as opposed to&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the saga of how it took six months and 75 messages for Uber Support to admit a billing error. The issue was quite simple. The receipt indicated that I paid via Uber Credits, however my credit card was charged for the fare. After countless hours of back-and-forth, Uber finally claimed that the receipt is incorrect. However, Uber has still not updated the receipt nor refunded&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 23, 2018, I took an UberX &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIP&lt;/span&gt; ride from the Philadelphia Airport. The &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; designation is thanks to my American Express Platinum Card, which also provides me with regular Uber Credits to use for rides. Although apparently, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIP&lt;/span&gt; service&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t extend beyond the ride to include interactions with customer service. Anyways, when soliciting the ride, the Uber app indicated I had outstanding Credits. After completing the ride, I was emailed a receipt that showed that the fare was paid via Uber Credits as expected (and not by credit&amp;nbsp;card).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily when reviewing my credit card activity a week later, I spotted an Uber charge for the ride fare of $20.34. I contacted Uber&amp;#8217;s customer support via message/email (the only method Uber provides for support). Uber insisted that the credit card charge was a temporary hold. I disagreed, providing evidence that the charge had posted. Eventually, I resorted to disputing the charge with my credit card company. This first episode consisted of 7 messages over 2&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward several months to October 21, 2018. I request an Uber ride via the app, but get told that I have an outstanding balance of $20.34. Although I realize that Uber&amp;#8217;s system has detected the chargeback and is attempting to charge me again for the June 23 ride, I have no choice but to pay, since I needed the ride urgently. A few days later I message Uber support inquiring about this new credit card charge, despite the receipt still indicating that Uber Credit was applied. This second episode continues for 3 months and consists of 68&amp;nbsp;messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My credit card ending in 4602 was charged the full amount for this ride despite my Uber receipt claiming the ride was covered with credits. What is going on? I have charged twice, once to my credits and once to my credit&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charge you’re seeing is an &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/why-is-there-a-pending-charge-on-my-payment-account?nodeId=320f2eca-45b7-4b80-ae15-df7edc6d87b1"&gt;authorization hold&lt;/a&gt; that has already been voided by Uber.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trip Request:&lt;/strong&gt; June 23rd, 2018 4:37 pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Authorization Amount:&lt;/strong&gt; $20.34
&lt;strong&gt;Voided:&lt;/strong&gt; June 24rd, 2018 4:01 am &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber places an &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/why-is-there-a-pending-charge-on-my-payment-account?nodeId=320f2eca-45b7-4b80-ae15-df7edc6d87b1"&gt;authorization hold&lt;/a&gt; at the start of every trip, including trips that are later canceled. This is a standard practice to confirm that your card has enough funds to cover the&amp;nbsp;fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve been charged only the actual fare of $20.34 for this trip. Since Uber has already released the hold, the authorization amount should soon be released by your bank. This typically happens within a few business&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s more information about how Uber uses authorization&amp;nbsp;holds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of a trip, Uber places a temporary hold on your payment method for the amount of the fare shown before your request, or upfront fare. This will show up as a &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; charge on your account. When the trip is complete, this hold is converted to a charge if the final fare was equal to the upfront fare. If your final fare is different than the upfront fare, the hold is voided, and the final fare gets charged to your payment method. In this case, you may see both the charge and authorization hold on your statement at the same time, until the hold is released by your&amp;nbsp;bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about when the hold will be released by your bank, we recommend contacting them&amp;nbsp;directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No the charge to my credit card is not an authorization hold. It posted on June 25, 2018 as my screenshot&amp;nbsp;shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very disappointing that I&amp;#8217;ve provided clear evidence of being double charged, and you are not looking into this issue more seriously. Please actually look into this&amp;#8230; the next step for me is disputing the charge via Captial One, my credit card&amp;nbsp;bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry to hear about the confusion,&amp;nbsp;Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other amount of &lt;strong&gt;$20.34&lt;/strong&gt; you are seeing is just an &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/why-is-there-a-pending-charge-on-my-payment-account?nodeId=320f2eca-45b7-4b80-ae15-df7edc6d87b1"&gt;authorization hold&lt;/a&gt; and you were not actually charged for this&amp;nbsp;amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to how hotels charge their guests, Uber places an authorization hold at the start of every trip, including canceled trips. This is to ensure that your card has enough funds to cover the&amp;nbsp;fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have double checked and confirmed that Uber voided the authorization for &lt;strong&gt;$20.34&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;6/24/2018 4:01am &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The funds have been released to your bank. You will need to contact your bank for any additional details about when you receive the&amp;nbsp;funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the transaction is successfully voided by Uber, we don&amp;#8217;t have any visibility into or control over the processing done at your&amp;nbsp;bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate your patience and understanding on this&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app and receipt showed that I paid this fare using Uber credits. However, my Captial One credit card ending in 4602 was charged $20.34. I openned a previous help ticket and Uber support claimed that the credit card charge was just an authorization hold, despite the fact that it had posted. Therefore, I disputed the charge with my credit card&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday October 21, 2018, I went to take an Uber ride and it would not let me proceed unless I paid an outstanding balance for $20.34. I was in a rush and clicked through the menus, it appears now that my American Express card ending in 1009 has been charged $20.34. Nonetheless the original trip receipt still shows that I paid for the ride with&amp;nbsp;credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please escalate this issue &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASAP&lt;/span&gt;. Something is very wrong that I am repeatedly being charged when the original ride was paid in&amp;nbsp;credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry to hear about the confusion, Daniel. Please allow me to look into this for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon careful review, I can confirm here the fare of $20.34 for this trip was successfully charged once under your card and not on your Uber&amp;nbsp;credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the other amount you’re seeing is just an &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/why-is-there-a-pending-charge-on-my-payment-account?nodeId=320f2eca-45b7-4b80-ae15-df7edc6d87b1"&gt;authorization hold&lt;/a&gt; that has already been voided by Uber.

&lt;p&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;Adora,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for looking into it. I have confirmed that a $20.34 charge from Uber posted to my Amex card ending in 1009 on October 21, 2018. I think we may be in agreement here because you write: &amp;#8220;I can confirm here the fare of $20.34 for this trip was successfully charged once under your card and not on your Uber&amp;nbsp;credits.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This however is an issue that any card of mine was charged. The original receipt showed (and &lt;a href="https://riders.uber.com/trips/c786435a-2ddb-4ff1-9665-83f429469460"&gt;still shows online&lt;/a&gt;) that the fare was paid with credits. Here is a screenshot of an email receipt which I just requested from the system&amp;nbsp;today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="uber-receipt-oct-24-email.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSVK91KMQKPFtzatrxGeMYjPHR8JSM3SxvZQpXa6zk9t8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how it shows the fare was paid with credits. What is frustrating is that Uber support previously claimed that my credit card was not charged for this ride and agreed I paid with credits. However, my credit card ending in 4602 was charged. Hence, I disputed the charge with my bank. Now four months later, my card ending in 1009 has been charged. Meanwhile the receipt continues to show that my app credits were used to fund the&amp;nbsp;ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;Jaspreet,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you saying you explicitly refunded my credit card ending in 1009? Otherwise, you have not addressed the problem. It sounds like you are saying that my credit card was never actually charged, which is false. Please read through all my previous messages in this&amp;nbsp;conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will go ahead and dispute the Oct 21 charge for the card ending in 1009, like I did previously for the card ending in 4602. However, there is a big issue if Uber cannot recognize that they are charging my credit cards for this ride. I repeat that the receipt shows that the fare was paid in credits. However, two credit cards of mine have now been charged. These charges were not authorizations&amp;#8230; they posted to the account. If you are unable to verify this, you need to escalate this ticket to an engineer, who can diagnose this serious system&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Bhavtosh for this more articulate response. I see we are in agreement my card ending in 1009 has been charged for the ride. However, the ride receipt shows that I paid via credits, so no credit card should be&amp;nbsp;charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not explain authorization holds anymore. They have no relevance here since we are only discussing credit card charges that have&amp;nbsp;posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again the issue is that I was double charged: once to my credits and once to my credit card (which I previously disputed and now to another&amp;nbsp;card).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your reply is not relevant to the issue at all. I have no complaint regarding the ride I took on October 21, 2018 for $17.93 ($15 of which was paid via Uber credit). My complaint is in regards to the charge for $20.34 to my Amex card ending in 1009 on October 21 for a ride from June 23,&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to the app on October 21, I received a message that I had an outstanding balance. I clicked through until my Amex card was selected, since I needed to get rid of this message to confirm an urgent ride. I am guessing that the Uber system has registered that Capital One had performed a chargeback for the $20.34 charge to my 4602 card, since I disputed it. Therefore, the system indicated I had an outstanding balance. However, the issue here is that the $20.34 fare from June 23 was paid via Uber credit as the receipt shows. Therefore, there should have been no credit card charges or outstanding&amp;nbsp;balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per the concern, we have double check your account transactions for this trip and would like to inform that the final charge was to your payment card ending in 1009 as the other charge on your card ending in 4602 is an authorization hold which has been already voided by Uber. For reference, we have also resent the receipt for this&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that Uber places an authorization hold at the start of every trip, including trips that are later canceled. This is a standard practice to confirm that your card has enough funds to cover the&amp;nbsp;fare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;GZuiK,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in agreement that my card ending in 1009 was charged $20.34 for the trip I took on June 23rd. I received the receipt you resent for this trip. It is consistent with the previous receipts for this trip, which show that the $20.34 was paid via Uber credits rather than credit card. The issue is that I have been double charged&amp;#8230; I paid via Uber credits as shown on the receipt and now a second time by my card ending in&amp;nbsp;1009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi GZuiK et&amp;nbsp;al,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t received a response to my last message. Can you please explain why I am being double charged for my ride from June 23? As the receipt shows, I paid via Uber credits. However, my credit card ending in 1009 has also been charged the full amount of $20.34. In fact, previously my credit card ending in 4602 was also charged, but I disputed the charge with Capital&amp;nbsp;One.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy to help,&amp;nbsp;Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to locate these charges, could you provide me with the following details? To protect your information, please do not include your full credit card&amp;nbsp;number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each charge, please&amp;nbsp;provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Date of the&amp;nbsp;charge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exact&amp;nbsp;amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type of card (debit,&amp;nbsp;credit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first 6 and last 4 digits of the credit&amp;nbsp;card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The expiration&amp;nbsp;date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, a family member or friend has used a credit card on their own Uber account.
Before sending us the details above, you may want to check with your family or close friends to ensure the charges were not from&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve provided us with the details above, we&amp;#8217;ll investigate the source of the charges. We look forward to hearing from&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;Rob,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the separate times I&amp;#8217;ve been charged for the ride. All charges were for the full ride fare of $20.34. For each charge, I&amp;#8217;ve submitted a&amp;nbsp;screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via Uber Credits on June 23, 2018 as shown in the app while requesting the ride and on the receipt. The screenshot shows my receipt from&amp;nbsp;Uber:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via Visa credit card &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXXX&lt;/span&gt;-XXxx-xxxx-4602 expiring January 2023, which posted on June 25, 2018. I disputed this charge and I believe Capital One performed a chargeback. The screenshot shows the posted charge from my online banking at Capital&amp;nbsp;One:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via Amex credit card &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYYY&lt;/span&gt;-YYyyyy-y1009 expiring January 2023, which posted on October 21, 2018. This charge occurred after the Uber app recently required me to pay an &amp;#8220;outstanding&amp;#8221; balance before being able to get another ride. The screenshot shows the transaction details exported from my online banking at American&amp;nbsp;Express:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completely understand how concerning it is to see an unknown charge, Daniel. I&amp;#8217;m happy to point you in the direction&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel, upon checking on our end it seems that your Uber account the amount of $20.34 was initially charged to your card ending in 4602, however, it was disputed with your bank. When fare disputes are initiated, they create an outstanding balance on your Uber account since the bank returns those funds directly back to your&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that on October 21, 2018 at 6:31pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDT&lt;/span&gt; the fare was successfully settled to your card ending in 1009. This is the reason why you are seeing this amount in your two separate cards. But the amount of $20.34 has been back to your card ending in&amp;nbsp;4602.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this information helps. Please let us know if we can help with anything&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;Rotchilly,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your assistance. I agree that at this moment, I have paid the fare only once by credit card (since I disputed the charge to 4602 with my bank and the funds were returned to my account). Soon I will dispute the charge to 1009 as well. The issue is that the receipt shows that I payed the fare via Uber Credits. Therefore, the Uber system has been double charging me: it charged my Uber Credits and my credit card for the same&amp;nbsp;fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I booked the ride, the app showed that I had Uber credits (in part due to my Amex Platinum card membership). The receipt for the ride shows that the fare was paid in &amp;#8220;Credits&amp;#8221;. Therefore, my credit card should never have been&amp;nbsp;charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there is an insidious issue with the Uber system. My receipt continues to rightly show that the fare was paid via Uber Credits (see screenshots from prior messages). However the &amp;#8220;My trips&amp;#8221; page &lt;a href="https://riders.uber.com/trips"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; shows the fare was paid via my card ending in&amp;nbsp;1009:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;Daniel,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to hear about the confusion&amp;nbsp;caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We experienced a technical issue that caused a delay in processing your&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge of $20.34 for the trip on June 23, 2018 was not collected at the time of the trip. This charge was processed on 22 Oct, 2018 and was only collected&amp;nbsp;once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can review past trips through your app by clicking the three bars in the upper left hand corner and then clicking ‘Your&amp;nbsp;Trips’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate your patience as we process this&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sent-by-daniel-h-on-monday-october-29-2018_1"&gt;Sent by Daniel H. on Monday, October 29,&amp;nbsp;2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks chiragS for the reply. I am afraid you are mistaken on a few&amp;nbsp;counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You write, &amp;#8220;The charge of $20.34 for the trip on June 23, 2018 was not collected at the time of the trip.&amp;#8221; This is incorrect. In fact, the charge was collected twice immediately following the trip. First it was collected from my Uber Credits as shown on the receipt. Second, it was charged to my credit card ending in&amp;nbsp;4602.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 3, 2018 I noticed this double charge by looking at my bank statement and contacted Uber support. Uber support claimed the charge to 4602 was just an authorization hold, despite my repeated provision of evidence to contrary. Therefore, I disputed the charge to 4602 with my credit card company who performed a chargeback. As Uber support realized in the message by &amp;#8220;Rotchilly H. on Monday, October 29, 2018 at 10:43:51 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;, this chargeback led to the Uber system charging me again for the fare, this time to the card ending in&amp;nbsp;1009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the underlying issue has not been remedied. The issue is that the fare was collected from both my Uber Credits as shown on the receipt and from my credit&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best,&amp;nbsp;Daniel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reaching out. I’m happy to&amp;nbsp;explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve reviewed your account and can confirm that you were not charged twice for your trip on June 23rd, 2018 4:37pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that you wanted to use the payment method ending in 4602 for this trip. However, we were unable to complete the transaction on that card and we charged your payment method ending in 1009&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to use the original card, please check with your bank to resolve any payment rejection&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being so&amp;nbsp;understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LL&lt;/span&gt;, thanks for the quick&amp;nbsp;reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is not that I have been charged twice to my credit card. The issue is that I was charged the full fare to my Uber Credits as well as being charged the full fare to my credit card ending in 4602. I disputed the charge to 4602 and subsequently was charged the full fare to my card ending in 1009. As it stands currently, I have paid twice: once via Uber Credits and a second time via my credit card ending in 1009. The credit card charge, however, is errant as the ride receipt shows the fare was paid via Uber&amp;nbsp;Credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can also confirm that you currently do not have an Uber credits available balance on your account at the time of this&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Ma. Kathleen C. Nice to see that this ticket has escalated to a higher level that can hopefully more effectively examine the&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I requested the ride, the app showed that I had Uber Credits available. Note that I would not have chosen this method of transportation on June 23 had I no Uber Credits. The original ride receipt, as emailed to me on June 23, 2018 following the ride, shows the fare was paid using Uber&amp;nbsp;Credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobile Android app previously showed a receipt that indicated the fare was paid via Uber Credits. However, when I just navigated to the receipt under &amp;#8220;Your Trips &amp;gt; Trip Details &amp;gt; Receipt&amp;#8221;, I see the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2018-10-29_uber-receipt-mobile-app.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUTqgJMv8AYxKuKWJTZJnJ2eKab1MxUac3jRutZ7HeLkz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the mobile receipt shows both credit card charges (I understand that the 4602 charge is void because I disputed it with my bank). Perhaps your investigation somehow changed the mobile&amp;nbsp;receipt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the receipt online and a resent email receipt still show that I paid via Uber Credits. Here is a screenshot of my receipt online (taken after I received your last&amp;nbsp;message):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how the receipt shows I paid the fare using Uber Credits. Therefore, it is incorrect to charge my credit&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately it appears your Uber Credit may have been switched off at the time of this&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can toggle credit &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/enabling-or-disabling-uber-credits-?nodeId=779e6dbb-b7ec-4724-9628-e2ea686187b0"&gt;On or Off&lt;/a&gt; after you&amp;#8217;ve set your destination and before you select your vehicle option. You can also see how many credits you have at any given point by clicking on Payment in your app&amp;nbsp;menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your credit is still available for your next trip. You can read more about enabling or disabling credits on &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/"&gt;help.uber.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if you&amp;#8217;re not able to see your Uber Cash balance in the Payments section of your Uber app, please restart the app. Be sure to completely close the app, rather than just leaving the app&amp;nbsp;screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to view your Uber Cash&amp;nbsp;balance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap the menu icon in the top left of the&amp;nbsp;app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Payment&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There you will see your balance of Uber&amp;nbsp;Cash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your current balance is &lt;strong&gt;$15.00&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still unable to see your credit balance after restarting the app, please send a screenshot of the &amp;#8220;Payment&amp;#8221; section of your app and we’ll investigate&amp;nbsp;further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;VaibhavM,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the information about how to apply Uber Credits to rides. I can confirm that my mobile app currently shows $15 of Amex Credits / Uber&amp;nbsp;Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I disagree that Uber Credits were switched off during my June 23, 2018 ride. Instead, the receipt clearly shows that fare was paid via Uber Credits. However, my credit card was also&amp;nbsp;charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help show what I&amp;#8217;ve mean, I&amp;#8217;ve applied red markup to my receipt retrieved today from the Uber&amp;nbsp;website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note how the receipt shows the fare was paid via &amp;#8220;Credits&amp;#8221;. Therefore, I do not believe the issue was that I switched Uber Credits &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OFF&lt;/span&gt; during this&amp;nbsp;ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Divya&amp;nbsp;K.,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that I have only presently paid once via credit card for the June 23 ride (since my bank chargebacked the payment via 4602). However, my credit card(s) should have never been charged at all for this ride, because the receipt shows that I paid via Uber Credit. Please reference the screenshot with red markup I provided in reply to VaibhavM, which clearly indicates that the receipt shows me paying via Uber Credits and not credit&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was my credit card charged when the receipt shows that I paid the fare via Uber&amp;nbsp;Credits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you give me a time estimate on how much longer it will take to address this issue?

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Rotchilly H. for the reply. Happy December! This will now be the 60th message with Uber support over this issue. Since your team appears to understand that there was an issue, why haven&amp;#8217;t I been reimbursed for the extra $20.34 charge? You can continue your internal investigation on your own time, but I don&amp;#8217;t understand why I should continually be denied financial remediation while the &amp;#8220;other team&amp;#8221; looks into the&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like Uber is unable to refund me until the investigation is completed. Therefore, it is of great interest to me how long the investigation will take. Can you provide me more information on the investigation? Specifically, which team at Uber is performing the investigation? Has the team made any progress with the investigation?

&lt;p&gt;Hi Rotchilly&amp;nbsp;H.,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately you did not answer my question. I specifically asked whether Laurence Red O was able to get in touch with the designated team and whether they provided him with any&amp;nbsp;updates?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, this is my 72nd message with Uber Support regarding this issue. The other team — whose name or department I have not been told — has been assigned to the issue for 40 days at this&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge has been that I don&amp;#8217;t have a dedicated customer support representative. Instead, every message I send receives a response from a different representative, who is unlikely to understand the gravity of this situation. Due to the number of messages I have sent, I have corresponded with certain representatives multiple&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the number of messages I have received from each representative: 4 from Rotchilly H.; 2 from Laurence Red O.; 2 from Ma. Kathleen C.; 1 from Adora Camille C.; 1 from Armina G.; 1 from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt;; 1 from Ashish B.; 1 from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;; 1 from Bhavtosh G.; 1 from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BS&lt;/span&gt;; 1 from chiragS; 1 from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DD&lt;/span&gt;; 1 from Divya K.; 1 from GZuiK; 1 from jaspreet; 1 from Jerico G.; 1 from Jezreel A.; 1 from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LL&lt;/span&gt;; 1 from Lovely M.; 1 from MayankS; 1 from Noel L.; 1 from Pankaj; 1 from Rob; 1 from Sam; 1 from samantaS; 1 from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;; and 1 from&amp;nbsp;VaibhavM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would it be possible to be assigned a dedicated representative to correspond with for the remainder of this issue? I have been least unsatisfied with the support provided by Noel L., Laurence Red O., and Lovely M.; so I would prefer to work directly with one of these representatives on getting the matter&amp;nbsp;resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greetings Uber support, I haven&amp;#8217;t received a response to my message from four days ago (December 14). Can you please&amp;nbsp;respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&amp;nbsp;Daniel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re sorry for the trouble and we appreciate your patience with us,&amp;nbsp;Daniel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon checking here on our end, it shows that the card charged for your trip is your Amex card ending in 1009. It looks there was just an error on the receipt that was sent to you that is why it showed that your credit was used for your&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I can confirm that we did not make any deductions to your credit balance for the fare of your trip. Also, the reason why the Uber app is showing your card ending in 4602 for this trip is that it was the original payment method selected for your trip and that we attempted to charge it but was unable to do so. Which is why you were shown an outstanding balance that you settled using your card ending in&amp;nbsp;1009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps. If you have any more questions we&amp;#8217;re always happy to help. You can contact us&amp;nbsp;anytime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! What incredibly dismal customer service Uber has. I am not sure of the legality of Uber&amp;#8217;s practices: for example, charging a payment method not listed on the receipt; failing to fix an incorrect receipt; or the outrageously obstructive customer service. Anyways, there are likely other Uber customers in a similar situation — that could form a formidable class — so please do get in&amp;nbsp;touch.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, these feats should only be attempted by a strong and frugal traveler, who is prepared to &lt;em&gt;leave no trace&lt;/em&gt;. We reject commercial tourism and those that desecrate the Hawaiin wilderness using motorized contraptions. Hike or bike, but avoid disturbing what remains of nature by financing trucks, helicopters, and&amp;nbsp;motorboats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="map"&gt;Map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We planned our trip by creating a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1n5mSaUnn9WsF_k7LGgF7n3Pc4xTQ45vO"&gt;custom map&lt;/a&gt; of&amp;nbsp;attractions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="custom map" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPL9K87SyxafiGTy78DPEB2jntUFz2C7JkoshqsnD46m6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to circumnavigate the island clockwise, beginning at Kona airport, where we rented the weakest car available from Hertz, a Nissan&amp;nbsp;Versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1-kealakekua-bay"&gt;Day 1: Kealakekua&amp;nbsp;Bay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://bigislandhikes.com/kealakekua-bay/"&gt;hiked to Kealakekua Bay&lt;/a&gt;, with the Big Island&amp;#8217;s best snorkeling and Captain Cook&amp;#8217;s Monument. &lt;a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ0Mzc4OQ=="&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; track&lt;/a&gt;. The hike is about 2 miles each way and&amp;nbsp;scenic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kealakekua Bay Hiking" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYsyZTEB5n8Bd6Hh5Xmwb9v4yoTg9evxqPkwWZVucUBDo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francesca joined us for this part of the journey. She&amp;#8217;s an Italian scientist currently living in Arizona, who performs some of the most advanced matrix computations for data integration in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bay, we found a nice hammock&amp;nbsp;spot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Kealakekua Bay Hammocking" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZcKeohzM1gJT7SWScfZvBxbihsKWgJzzUs93gTGFX6J8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main attraction however is the snorkeling. Put on some goggles, jump in, and witness your world transform into a colorful cacophony of marine mania. We didn&amp;#8217;t get any pictures of the underwater view, but on shore the sun gave birth to crustacean&amp;nbsp;reds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="crustacean reds" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUWWYVTFimJaLZW4H6FxyujkHT9p9db241gaNVHnzrkoo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove north this night and camped at &lt;a href="https://hawaiicounty.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,details,57791.html"&gt;Mãhukona Beach Park&lt;/a&gt;, which was somewhat sketch especially considering its $42 price tag for 2&amp;nbsp;non-residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2-pololu-valley-and-muliwai-trail"&gt;Day 2: Pololū Valley and Muliwai&amp;nbsp;Trail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started day 2 with a &lt;a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ3MjU2MA=="&gt;short hike&lt;/a&gt; down to the beach at &lt;a href="https://www.lovebigisland.com/pololu-valley/"&gt;Pololū Valley&lt;/a&gt;. The view looking out towards the 7 valleys of the Kohala Volcana was impressive and a nice reminder of the wilderness we were about to&amp;nbsp;explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MVIMG_20190109_082117.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQEtUVU2rpna1873PudY9u699mWtH31uy7721yb6qdpW4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we drove around Kohala Volcana to reach Waipi’o Valley (the easternmost valley). From there we set out to hike the Muliwai Trail to &lt;a href="https://bigislandhikes.com/waimanu-valley/"&gt;Waimanu Valley&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ3MjU2MQ=="&gt;tracks&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PANO_20190109_112824.vr.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSumm2jQPZzJKZeWa2FRr8pD3ESDHRU4AhGQMuFB45Rxf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out @trang&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://busy.org/@trang/zy5zezs6"&gt;amazing video&lt;/a&gt; recounting our time at Waimanu Valley. The hike was&amp;nbsp;scenic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_20190109_151729.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYYSCTFZ1aZ2KH8mAwMGUfnLtEXvf193f1vPdsYYiZp9W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;nbsp;wet&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rain on Muliwai Trail gif" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmR7uC1UNLw957FSqStyf1JKku9xXfBZqBm3hSSePUA12e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the time we reached camp, &lt;em&gt;dark&lt;/em&gt;. We stayed at campsite 1 (&lt;a href="https://camping.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,map,31720.html"&gt;map download&lt;/a&gt;), which was pretty good, although campsite 2 has the best view and fire pit, and served as the socialization venue for all the&amp;nbsp;expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3-waimanu-valley"&gt;Day 3: Waimanu&amp;nbsp;Valley&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The view in the morning was worth&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Waimanu Valley" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmeir78Pq3Su9xveWEkawjo6WXzhPNGBAZpDhRgsgdRPfN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued along the valley perimeter along an unmaintained trail network to reach Waihilau Falls, the 14th tallest &lt;a href="https://www.worldwaterfalldatabase.com/tallest-waterfalls/total-height"&gt;waterfall in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Waihilau Falls" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVYxrcccpcwAzTPjS4ThhUwUkZnvvAGVDJyq7F9MBgEd2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this is the jungle and the trek is&amp;nbsp;treacherous:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="spider webs" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmdzpqgcDpa5ticwK5vDq9t22J3QyWKrSuFYksF2UBhDu8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night we had a gathering of the vibes with other&amp;nbsp;attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4-vacating-the-valleys"&gt;Day 4: Vacating the&amp;nbsp;Valleys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hiked out early. By the way, did I mention there are two major water crossings: Waimanu Stream and Queen&amp;#8217;s River. The beauty however is that you get to experience where the fresh meets the salt waters. Watch @trang cross Waimanu&amp;nbsp;Stream:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="waimanu-stream-crossing-reduced-size.gif" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYYi7ttMD4xNv7ZkXBWHnvVjcQ8EbuTqyV2ft9ke2mz4H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike out went smoothly. Overall, this outing comprised 22 miles of hiking and 10,600 feet of elevation&amp;nbsp;gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night we stayed at a cottage in Hilo, which despite costing over $100 was worse than every other spot we stayed. However, we were able to do laundry and rest up for our big ascent coming&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5-mauna-kea"&gt;Day 5: Mauna&amp;nbsp;Kea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove to the visitors station at Mauna Kea at an elevation of 9,200 feet. The Nissan Versa struggled to perform internal combustion at the lowered oxygen levels. From there, we began the hike to the summit of Mauna Kea, the highest peak in Hawaii at 13,803 feet and the tallest mountain in the world if plucked from the&amp;nbsp;root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite augmentation with 10 milligrams of acetazolamide, I felt elevation weakness, even at the visitation centre. Step by step, we ascended this dormant volcano and sacred landmark via the &lt;a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/visiting-mauna-kea/hiking.html"&gt;Humu&amp;#8217;ula Trail&lt;/a&gt;. We passed two other hikers on the way, who were unprepared in almost every way possible — inadequate sun protection, inadequate thermal layering, inadequate water supply, inadequate altitude acclimation. To the best of our knowledge, this couple never made it to the&amp;nbsp;top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way, we stopped by Lake Waiau, Hawaii&amp;#8217;s only alpine lake and a place of great historical importance as ancient peoples would deposit umbilical cords of newborns here as a ritual to promote&amp;nbsp;longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PANO_20190112_141022.vr.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQhXajA1r6g7Fh69WSr4nNgPd1QPFzGjwrpJtTyuKPUXN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other visitors stopped by and took a photo for&amp;nbsp;us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZ454LSxjQKXuC7r8tXc254p8bd8vVQnP8w7GynWYav3e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the visitors kept throwing rocks in the lake, which annoyed me because the lake &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014EO140001" title="Tracking Dramatic Changes at Hawaii’s Only Alpine Lake. 2014"&gt;already struggles enough&lt;/a&gt; with maintaining its&amp;nbsp;depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a &lt;a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ3MjU2Mg=="&gt;total&lt;/a&gt; of 6.5 miles, we reached the summit and enjoyed the&amp;nbsp;views:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PANO_20190112_154537.vr.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbP5E3dLSWm8RYbUoSLy7kYUcRbtTrG8YutGqV14yn3qx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauna Kea is also special for being one of the premier sites on the earth for astronomical observation. The area surrounding the summit is currently home to 13 telescopic&amp;nbsp;observatories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTndUqNefcbAGdCmQinofgeqARXireyL3A65UAi89CkwF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A telescope much greater than any of the existing telescopes has been planned. Its name: the Thirty Meter Telescope. However, there has been much resistance to this telescope and protesters halted the construction in 2015. Recently, court rulings &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-04444-2" title="Embattled Thirty Meter Telescope scores big win in Hawaii’s highest court"&gt;have sided&lt;/a&gt; with the telescope. On our drive around the island, we saw many &amp;#8220;Save Mauna Kea&amp;#8221; signs advocating against the telescope. While I generally side with preservationists, I don&amp;#8217;t see the merits of stopping this important eye into the sky and hence the history of the universe. Furthermore, the telescope will be recessed from the summit. Personally, I find the proposed design aesthetically pleasing and think it would contribute to the legacy and myth of the&amp;nbsp;mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hitchhiked down and arrived to Nāmakanipaio Campground at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Due to special circumstances called partial government shutdown, the campground was not collecting fees. This happened to be the most luxurious car camping spot we stayed on the Big&amp;nbsp;Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-6-volcanoes-national-park"&gt;Day 6: Volcanoes National&amp;nbsp;Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="shutdown-reduced-size.gif" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNeScFKNsUk2ErjcasrAwrkWm2JokcpBf5G1FPj7R5K6F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the longest government shutdown in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; history, a higher percent of the lands at Volcanoes National Park were forbidden than usual. Therefore, we are substituting this part with the itinerary we would have liked to do were the park fully&amp;nbsp;open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had planned to hike the &lt;a href="https://bigislandhikes.com/napau-trail/"&gt;Nāpau Trail&lt;/a&gt; into the backcountry, where one can witness lava flows and steam&amp;nbsp;vents:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="steam-vents.gif" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmctx1HH6zAB1em7SBRskcWFdN4nm4khyPsPYB3m4hKW6M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold the gigantic &lt;em&gt;Cibotium menziesii&lt;/em&gt; (Hawaiian Tree&amp;nbsp;Fern):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ferns png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSkAs7s6gbPrUbH7vr14o4x7kH51dVWzV355gR32RFsz3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we had to settle for some déjà vu backcountry&amp;nbsp;solitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="tent setup png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmauAtXQWNqbvF1DJtNsqwM3yxsj77z33CmfojDde8YrMz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-7-volcanoes-national-park"&gt;Day 7: Volcanoes National&amp;nbsp;Park&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did get to walk along Rim Drive to get a nice vantage point of Kīlauea&amp;nbsp;Crater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PANO_20190114_125845.vr.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmaRy6732QUvNfUL6FGeKz6moZbjzxymx2NbF2D934DSHp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeping lava continuously for 35 years, Kīlauea and its subordinates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav7046" title="The 2018 rift eruption and summit collapse of Kīlauea Volcano"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; increased volcanic activity last summer. During this period, the magma exhausted itself. Hence, there was no lava anywhere on the Big Island for the duration of our&amp;nbsp;visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the night of day 7, we camped at &lt;a href="https://hawaiicounty.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,details,57795.html"&gt;Whittington Beach Park&lt;/a&gt;, which was scenic and only very slightly sketch. We dined at both the southernmost bakery and southernmost restaurant in the United States (both recommended), located in the town of&amp;nbsp;Naalehu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-8"&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day 8, we made it near the southernmost point in the United States. We &lt;a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ5NjczMg=="&gt;hiked&lt;/a&gt; to the Green Sand&amp;nbsp;Beach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="green sand selfie.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNQuUdRz4niJTTrizqVtrdPZQNhu13ob9BkNAhfcArAeW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see most other visitors hiking rather than purchasing a ride on a 4×4, since the automobiles do considerable damage to the landscape, which made for a nice&amp;nbsp;photo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="green sand beach ruts.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmexm1z5t2VxQf78mJ47qYwRB34Rr1LbbsSyKs8GR7A67F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hike we were reminded of the onslaught of plastic pollution humans are littering the ocean&amp;nbsp;with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXWHfRdZDBBkphgcGnMCkxMD2t9eD1CJHz5RghkP2YJVm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must all do our part to address this crisis. @trang and I pick up as much litter as possible when traveling and around the streets of Philly. On the bright side, people are waking up to the issue and are prototyping solutions. For the second time, we just missed sighting &lt;a href="https://www.theoceancleanup.com/"&gt;The Ocean Cleanup&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s System 001, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheOceanCleanup/status/1086220492351115264"&gt;brought&lt;/a&gt; to Hilo Harbor for repairs a couple days after we passed&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we went to the southernmost point cliff jump where there were many fishermen but few jumpers. I was worried that the moderately high surf would make connecting with the ladder following the 40-foot jump dangerous. But, @trang decided she was doing it regardless. I asked her whether she&amp;#8217;d ever jumped from a high height. She said&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we walked the plank, me then&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="dhimmel plank.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPiCLLiQVjcwMAjFi6DsneRcqisRioPyAzvMykrtyXYnN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="trang plank.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmejsjfHGv1KmFpvDPXPzEejuJGN9QDBKSfqcmsapNMwJS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both enjoyed the jump. Although, I think @trang will make sure to have a more streamlined landing on her next jump! Finally we drove north, snorkeled at Honaunau Beach, and ate rambutan before hopping on a red eye flight back to the&amp;nbsp;mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bonus"&gt;Bonus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were in Hawaii before this vacation for a conference called the &lt;a href="https://psb.stanford.edu/"&gt;Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing&lt;/a&gt;. At the conference, I led a &lt;a href="https://slides.com/dhimmel/psb/"&gt;working group&lt;/a&gt; on Manubot, where participants learned how to use Manubot for collaboratively writing a &lt;a href="https://git.dhimmel.com/psb-manuscript/"&gt;manuscript&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time we checked out some local attractions such as Hapuna Beach. We even rented convertible BMWs, which were free to&amp;nbsp;borrow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bmw-biking.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQtLJhHnK36iQtiY2oxTnLdyx8YBhBMfo2M5deZ1JasMs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makalawena Beach was nice and included a resident seal. We imitated petroglyphs with our&amp;nbsp;shadows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunset walking back from Makalawena Beach was&amp;nbsp;picturesque:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had parked at the southern trailhead. Apparently, the park closes at 7:00 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;. Be out by then. A security personal tailgated us for 10 minutes with great rage. To this person&amp;#8217;s dismay, we cleared the gates at 6:59 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, so he was not able to ticket&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, sea&amp;nbsp;turtles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first day was full of day hikers and alpine ibex (bouquetin in French). They ibex were surprisingly indifferent to humans. I was a tad bit worried that I was too close to this male, but I couldn&amp;#8217;t resist the intrigue of the&amp;nbsp;shot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I took this picture, we ended up hiking together for a while. I guess we were both going up. Later I ran into this herd of&amp;nbsp;females:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first night, I slept outside Refuge du Lac Blanc, which was surrounded by snow and yet to open for the season. At sunset, I got the &lt;em&gt;red&lt;/em&gt; experience from within my cocoon 2,350 meters above sea&amp;nbsp;level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNwFnm8mmPBXEDXtSLGs7LnM9c8WNKuwckuBHeYoNhE5i --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with a &amp;#8220;refuge&amp;#8221;, it&amp;#8217;s the European equivalent of glamping. With only 8 euros in my belt pocket, I stuck to &amp;#8220;wild camping&amp;#8221;. In fact, even the water on this hike was free, a rarity for European travel! Quick aside, I filtered the water, but other hikers drank it straight, only avoiding water from areas of the mountain with ski&amp;nbsp;lifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I departed Refuge du Lac Blanc before sunrise, as I was just a bit too cold to actually sleep. At this early hour, I had the trail to myself. Just me and a full moon looking across at the&amp;nbsp;glaciers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AEVRVKiD1Rk2SPcf9"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for a more immersive experience brought to you by a photo sphere. The mountains were very much alive. At several sections, a fountain of boulders seemed to be erupting from the tectonic depths of these formidable alpine&amp;nbsp;formations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmccCWck7TPjuwCQV2nsPYYue8eYC1iqw6s6HzokHkEZfH --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rocks.jpg" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/aiguilles-rouges/06-rocks.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me to the evening to reach the summit of Le Brévent, which at 2,515 meters was also the peak of my hike. The beauty of the &lt;a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/bYTJ2ckpMSqSLxRQ7"&gt;360 degree view&lt;/a&gt; was only diminished by the presence of man-made access (a marvelous cable car) and the encroaching&amp;nbsp;darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descent from Le Brévent proved challenging as the snowpack was much more formidable on the west-facing side of the mountain range. After climbing down some ladders, I reached an impasse where the trail traversed a large patch of snow at a considerable incline. While the tracks of previous mountaineers made it clear where the trail went, I took one step onto the snowy traverse, which began to crumble beneath my foot, before deciding to attempt an alternative&amp;nbsp;route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVX3dctrdpGgGi917UNg5zvRNEktC7KKNmByJEyA16z1Z --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="alternate-route.jpg" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/aiguilles-rouges/07-alternate-route.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to circumnavigate the snow patch by descending below the snow-covered trail via the exposed gravel. This proved to be a challenging &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; frightening maneuver. The gravel was extremely loose. Meanwhile, I was exhausted with only adrenaline propelling me onward to crawl across the mountain in complete isolation. While I certainly made many mistakes to get myself into this situations, I did do one thing properly: I made sure not to panic. I kept silently repeating &amp;#8220;one step at a time&amp;#8221; and reminding myself to take as much time as I needed. 45 minutes later I was back on the trail, delighted to be&amp;nbsp;alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reflected on ways the situation could have been improved. It would have been helpful to save such a difficult section for earlier in the day when I had more energy and when there were other hikers around. An ice axe would have been nice. I probably should have followed the snowy traverse like the others hikers before me. However, the confidence and experience from this snafu would come in handy the following day, when I would encounter similarly difficult terrain but for a more prolonged stretch of the&amp;nbsp;trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally reached less rugged terrain. I passed waterfall after waterfall pouring down from the horrid heights that I had just&amp;nbsp;breached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmY6JmCixVCNwPJLYKzSeV1xJuRE1T356pCerVzTmk5KxJ --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="waterfall-and-snow.jpg" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/aiguilles-rouges/08-waterfall-and-snow.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hiked late, in search of sufficient tree cover to rig a hammock. I took the first opportunity I saw, which had me laying across the trail. The next morning I awoke to a hiker crouching beneath my hanging mattress to&amp;nbsp;pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYSQUz9pXGM9DoVGt17ntiyeRZxM9SxEcUBHAQ2ekjdTW --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="hammocking-across-trail.jpg" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/aiguilles-rouges/09-hammocking-across-trail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued onward, hiking through a valley devoid of human civilization on either side, except for a few chalets, most of them long abandoned and turned to ruins discernible only as stone outlines of their former selves. Nothing like a bath in the fresh snow-melt of the Alps to rekindle the&amp;nbsp;spirit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYinsTEwxcfZKW5tUL8urVREnDBGtBaiXtxroQCgndvC4 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="swimming.jpg" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/aiguilles-rouges/10-swimming.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this pleasure soon turned into a brutal ascent. Luckily I caught up to a pack of&amp;nbsp;Frenchmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTuDMAMR4icRVY1WqMvQnqTbun1o9iLpT23MThXT3W5Sm --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="frenchmen.jpg" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/aiguilles-rouges/11-frenchmen.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approached Col de Salenton, the pass through which we would cross the ridge to descend into the Valley of Bérard, the clouds reminded us of the high&amp;nbsp;altitude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmW5K1JP5JdReaktFD79541o7FVLeYiv6rSr659cpZZkuq --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="col-de-salenton.jpg" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/aiguilles-rouges/12-col-de-salenton.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, unlike the day before, I was unwavering in my step. The Frenchmen even assumed I was a veteran, at which point I had to tell them that I had no idea what I was doing. The valley on the other side was blanketed in snow. We decided that following the buried path was a losing battle, and took to glissading whenever&amp;nbsp;possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="videoWrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe width="604" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZLRPi7b1dA?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=light&amp;showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the base of the slope was the Refuge de la Pierre à Bérard. Before reaching it, I had broken a trekking pole and scraped my buttock, but we eventually all made it down in one piece. I said au revoir to my hiking companions and continued&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slept only a couple miles from the end of the tour. The next morning, I returned to&amp;nbsp;civilization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmWQY92rHvZfmavbKYRLUNTyfk34FWdW3mB6NkpvZknBQ9 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cows-alps.jpg" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/aiguilles-rouges/13-cows-alps.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, I had hiked 34.6 miles (56 kilometers). &lt;a href="http://my.viewranger.com/track/details/Nzg5MzQzNA=="&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s my track&lt;/a&gt; via&amp;nbsp;ViewRanger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, I was impressed by my &lt;a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/8pklim"&gt;packing list&lt;/a&gt;. While you&amp;#8217;ll find many packing lists online geared towards hiking, I needed to accommodate both my professional presentations in Switzerland and my hike of the French Alps. Hence, I had to lug around my laptop, but was still able to achieve a base weight of 14.4 pounds. How&amp;#8217;s that for an #ultralight&amp;nbsp;#steemian-boss?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="acknowledgements"&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big shout-out to Olivier Lessard, a French friend I met while in San Francisco, who not only told me about the Tour des Aiguilles Rouges, but also put me in touch with his siter Ann, who housed me for two nights in the outskirts of Geneva. Olivier will be happy to learn that I completed the hike in 2.5 days (3 nights) rather than the customary 4 days. This enabled me to hike the Mer de Glace the following day and complete my goal to touch a&amp;nbsp;glacier.&lt;/p&gt;

Also note how the&amp;nbsp;letter &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; was appended&amp;nbsp;to &lt;code&gt;Van Noorden, 2013&lt;/code&gt; to denote that this is the first of the two Van Noorden articles from 2013 that we&amp;nbsp;cited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the same paragraph as above, but using numeric-style, which is the default for Manubot – the tool we used to write the &lt;a href="https://greenelab.github.io/scihub-manuscript/" title="Sci-Hub Coverage Study manuscript via Manubot"&gt;manuscript&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using numeric-style citations, references are numbered according to the order they were cited.
As such, the references section (bibliography) is a numbered&amp;nbsp;list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="usage-in-pubmed-central"&gt;Usage in PubMed&amp;nbsp;Central&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, each journal (or even publisher) has a preferred citation style that&amp;#8217;s applied to all of their articles.
However, I couldn&amp;#8217;t find much information on the overall prevalence of the two styles.
Hence, I turned to the PubMed Central (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMC&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/" title="PMC Open Access Subset Homepage"&gt;Open Access (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OA&lt;/span&gt;) Subset&lt;/a&gt;, which as of March 4, 2018 contained fulltexts for 1,875,131 articles in a standardized machine-readable format (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JATS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;).
This corpus is fantastic for text &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; data mining.
Note it could be even better, but due to licensing issues, 61% of the 4.8 million articles in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMC&lt;/span&gt; are excluded from its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OA&lt;/span&gt; Subset:
please help by only publishing in &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/S8uKk5" title="DOAJ Search for CC BY Journals"&gt;libre &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;journals!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, 1,602,392 articles included citations and references (&lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/dhimmel/pmc-citation-styles" title="dhimmel/pmc-citation-styles on GitLab"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;).
I crafted a &lt;em&gt;heuristic&lt;/em&gt; (a bunch of handmade rules) to classify the citation style of an article as numeric, author, or unknown.
While there&amp;#8217;s no guarantee the algorithm correctly classifies every citation/article, I fed it a collection of &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/dhimmel/pmc-citation-styles/blob/d08b920861aef667ef7edb84c12c35ba119a69df/utils/test_utils.py#L80-110" title="test_utils.py: test cases for citation style classification"&gt;test cases&lt;/a&gt; (enforced via &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/550143a" title="Andrew Silver. Collaborative software development made easy. Nature Toolbox. 2017-10-14"&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;) to ensure it&amp;#8217;s not too&amp;nbsp;misbehaved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 86.0% of articles used numeric-style and 12.2% used author-style (the algorithm could not resolve 1.8% of articles, classifying them as unknown).
Here&amp;#8217;s the popularity of each citation style by year of publication (absolute counts on the left, normalized proportions on the&amp;nbsp;right):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Popularity of citation styles by year" src="https://gitlab.com/dhimmel/pmc-citation-styles/raw/d08b920861aef667ef7edb84c12c35ba119a69df/figure/years-mutlipanel.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see that each year more articles were added to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OA&lt;/span&gt; Subset than the year before, with a total of 255,736 articles added from 2017.
However, the relative popularity of author- versus numeric-style citations has remained relatively&amp;nbsp;constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the proliferation of unknown-style articles from 2008–2012?
These are almost all from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acta_Crystallographica"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acta Crystallographica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series of journals, which hyperlinks citations using the ▶ symbol.
See &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793688/" title="De Silva et al. 2013. Acta Crystallographica Section E: Structure Reports. DOI: 10.1107/S1600536813018643"&gt;&lt;code&gt;PMC3793688&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for example.
Manual inspection reveals that &lt;em&gt;Acta Crystallographica&lt;/em&gt; references are actually&amp;nbsp;author-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some easter&amp;nbsp;eggs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2003 and 2004, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Biology&lt;/em&gt; published 283 articles using author-style citations before switching to numeric-style, which remains the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; style to this&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The article with the most references at 3,112 is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.59.6261"&gt;World checklist of hornworts and liverworts&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;PhytoKeys&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4758082/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;PMC4758082&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), which used author-style for its 12,274 in-text&amp;nbsp;citations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The article with the second-most references at 2,857 is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-014-2981-5"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QCD&lt;/span&gt; and strongly coupled gauge theories&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;The European Physical Journal C&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4413533/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;PMC4413533&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), which uses numeric-style to render its 3,679 in-text&amp;nbsp;citations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-worst-case"&gt;The worst&amp;nbsp;case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, I&amp;#8217;ll go over the pros and cons of author- versus numeric-style.
But first, I want to introduce the Project Rephetio manuscript that will help exhibit the &lt;em&gt;worst-case&lt;/em&gt; performance of the two&amp;nbsp;styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Rephetio was the final act of my PhD, and we took a &lt;a href="https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#realtime-open-science-thinklab"&gt;radically open&lt;/a&gt; approach for this study.
First, we used the (now defunct) website Thinklab to post our proposal and publicly discuss the project while it was underway.
All code was posted immediately to GitHub under an open license.
Data was also uploaded to GitHub, or if too large, to Figshare.
In the end, the project encompassed 86 Thinklab discussions, 41 &lt;a href="https://git.io/v5zvX"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repositories (23 of which we archived on &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/FMiqHq"&gt;Zenodo&lt;/a&gt;), 9 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/ccq3"&gt;Figshare&lt;/a&gt; records, and several prepublication manuscripts (i.e. via Manubot, Thinklab, and &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Project Rephetio manuscript was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26726"&gt;eventually published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; with a total of 394 citations to 241 references.
I was the first author of 93 of the references, which took a full three pages of bibliography in &lt;a href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/citation-styles/elife-26726-v2.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; uses&amp;nbsp;author-style):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Project Rephetio eLife PDF: all references to Himmelstein first-author works" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/citation-styles/elife-26726-v2-himmelstein-refs.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one of these &amp;#8220;self-citations&amp;#8221; was to a traditional scholarly output — the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259" title="Himmelstein &amp;amp; Baranzini. 2015. Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes. PLOS Computational Biology"&gt;predecessor study&lt;/a&gt; to Project Rephetio.
The remaining 92 references were to non-traditional outputs generated during the course of the study:
62 Thinklab discussions/documents, 24 Zenodo records, 5 Figshare records, and 1&amp;nbsp;preprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As scientific communication grows beyond immutable journal articles in the coming decades, we can expect to see more and more studies like Project Rephetio, which will have a large number of references to non-journal outputs, such as code, data, and discussion forums.
Today&amp;#8217;s worst-case bibliography will be tomorrow&amp;#8217;s average&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="which-style-is-best"&gt;Which style is&amp;nbsp;best?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which style do &lt;strong&gt;I prefer?
Numeric-style!&lt;/strong&gt;
The worst-case performance of author-style is unacceptable.
The benefits of author-style are becoming less and less relevant to modern scholarship and publication&amp;nbsp;media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate my point, let&amp;#8217;s examine the pros of each style.
For this task, we&amp;#8217;ll refer to a paragraph from Project Rephetio.
Here&amp;#8217;s the paragraph in author-style, via &lt;a href="https://lens.elifesciences.org/26726/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; Lens&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Project Rephetio via eLife Lens: author-style citations" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/citation-styles/rephetio-cites-author.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s the same paragraph in numeric-style via &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io/p/rephetio/report/#edges"&gt;Thinklab&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Project Rephetio via Thinklab: numeric-style citations" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/citation-styles/rephetio-cites-numeric.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="advantages-of-author-style"&gt;Advantages of&amp;nbsp;author-style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author-style has several&amp;nbsp;benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can recognize the referenced work from just its in-text citation.&lt;/strong&gt;
For example, you don&amp;#8217;t need a reference section to know which study this sentence cites (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/171737a0" title="Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid"&gt;Watson &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Crick, 1953&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, science has grown.
No one has the mental capacity to remember every study in their field.
Nowadays, imagine you&amp;#8217;re reading a genomics study and encounter a citation&amp;nbsp;to &lt;code&gt;Li et al., 2017&lt;/code&gt;.
Even if you&amp;#8217;d memorized every genomics study in PubMed, you&amp;#8217;d still be choosing between &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/xUHY8i" title="Search PubMed for records published in 2017 with a first author of Li and a MeSH term of genomics"&gt;84 papers&lt;/a&gt;.
Furthermore, the advantages of immediate recognizability are scant when hovering over a citation pops-up a tooltip with full reference information.
Also, there&amp;#8217;s less room for misrecognition when readers are always shown the full author list, title, and journal information when investigating a&amp;nbsp;citation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first author is more visibly credited.&lt;/strong&gt;
Credit is important in science.
As a first author, it can certainly be nice to find your surname in the main text of articles that you&amp;#8217;ve influenced.
Unfortunately, science is rarely a one-(wo)man job these days, with biomedical publications &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15200/winn.141832.26907" title="Robert Aboukhalil · 2014 · The rising trend in authorship · Winnower"&gt;now averaging&lt;/a&gt; over five authors.
Precisely since credit is so important for propelling the academic enterprise forward, we should avoid systems that tend to improperly credit individuals over&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dates help readers establish the chronology of prior work and quickly identify outdated citations.&lt;/strong&gt;
For example, the average R&amp;amp;D cost of a new drug in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; is $93 million (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199507020-00007" title="DiMasi, Hansen, Grabowski, Lasagna. Research and Development Costs for New Drugs by Therapeutic Category. PharmacoEconomics. 1995"&gt;DiMasi et al., 1995&lt;/a&gt;).
However, numeric-style citations still allow readers to access dates, albeit with an extra step.
And when trying to reconstruct the chronology of a certain topic, I&amp;#8217;ll often need to see the precise date in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; 8601&lt;/a&gt; format&amp;nbsp;(e.g. &lt;code&gt;2018-03-12&lt;/code&gt;), which is too verbose for in-text citations&amp;nbsp;anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citations and references can be prepared independently&lt;/strong&gt;, without the assistance of a typesetting program.
Not having to renumber every reference when adding a citation to the beginning of a document is a big advantage if you&amp;#8217;re typesetting manually.
However, there&amp;#8217;s always the risk of author-year collisions, which either breaks the independence of citations and references or results in ambiguous&amp;nbsp;citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the future of scholarly writing is cite-by-identifier.
For example, I&amp;#8217;d cite Project Rephetio by its Digital Object Identifier&amp;nbsp;like &lt;code&gt;[@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726]&lt;/code&gt;.
Then, typesetting software, such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/manubot/rootstock"&gt;Manubot&lt;/a&gt;, retrieves the corresponding bibliographic metadata and automatically formats both the citations and references according to &lt;a href="https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles"&gt;whatever style&lt;/a&gt; you&amp;nbsp;specify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="advantages-of-numeric-style"&gt;Advantages of&amp;nbsp;numeric-style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#8217;s look at the advantages of&amp;nbsp;numeric-style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numeric-style is more space efficient.&lt;/strong&gt;
The 394 author-style citations from Project Rephetio consumed a total of 8,542 characters (excluding the surrounding parentheses and multi-citation separators, &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/dhimmel/pmc-citation-styles/blob/d08b920861aef667ef7edb84c12c35ba119a69df/07.rephetio-stats.ipynb"&gt;notebook&lt;/a&gt;).
That&amp;#8217;s an average of 21.7 characters per citation versus 2.6 for numeric-style.
Author-style citations required 8 times as many characters&amp;nbsp;numeric-style!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numeric-style is less distracting.&lt;/strong&gt;
Author-style citations can be visually distracting because they introduce large gaps into the flow of the prose.
To avoid this disruption, author-style encourages grouping citations rather than interspersing them throughout a sentence.
It also discourages citing a large number of works.
The number and position of citations in scholarly writing should not be constrained by what is essentially a user-interface&amp;nbsp;limitation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numeric lookup of references is easiest.&lt;/strong&gt;
For both humans and machines, it&amp;#8217;s easier to navigate a numbered list compared to an alphabetical one.
This is especially true when the alphabetical list has multiple references from the same first author.
If you disagree, I challenge you to pick a Himmelstein citation from the snippet above and try to find it in the alphabetical reference compilation.
Also notice&amp;nbsp;the &lt;code&gt;Himmelstein et al.&lt;/code&gt; references get all the way&amp;nbsp;to &lt;code&gt;2015z&lt;/code&gt;… I wonder&amp;nbsp;if &lt;code&gt;2015aa&lt;/code&gt; would have been&amp;nbsp;next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numeric-style citations do not degrade when citing works without first authors.&lt;/strong&gt;
Sometimes references don&amp;#8217;t have authors.
Or the author is an organization or consortium.
Author-style references can get quite unwieldy in these circumstances.
For example, check out this dataset citation as per &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s author-style, which consumes 71&amp;nbsp;characters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pounds of meat purchased per household during 2006 was extracted from the 2011 Food Environment Atlas (&lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads.aspx"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, 2014&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="treatise"&gt;Treatise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain types of writing, author-style citations do make sense.
Particularly, author-style is good for short, informal documents without a separate references section.
This includes emails, Steem posts, GitHub issues, and even blog posts.
Of course, you should hyperlink author-style citations to the referenced work, so there&amp;#8217;s no&amp;nbsp;ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in today&amp;#8217;s scholarly environment, numeric-style is preferable for substantial manuscripts, where several failure modes of author-style citations are beginning to appear.
For the publishers out there, here are some&amp;nbsp;takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re using author-style citations, consider switching to numeric-style. &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; designed their interfaces with user experience of readers in mind.
Interestingly, they both chose author-style.
It will be informative to see if they decide to switch to&amp;nbsp;numeric-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re using numeric-style citations, make sure that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; manuscript views provide tooltips with reference metadata. See for example, the Thinklab style above, which not only provides tooltips, but also highlights numeric citations by their type
(&lt;span style="background-color: #E5E5E5"&gt;external&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style="background-color: #D1F3FE"&gt;project discussion&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span style="background-color: #D9FFDE"&gt;code or data&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider reformatting the style of references.
I &lt;a href="https://github.com/manubot/rootstock/issues/53"&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; the title should go first, before authors, as seen in the Manubot-generated references above.
Always provide a standard identifier or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; in references.
It&amp;#8217;s the single most important element of a textual reference.
In other&amp;nbsp;words, &lt;code&gt;PMC4805733&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;https://doi.org/cmbr&lt;/code&gt; is a better reference&amp;nbsp;than &lt;code&gt;A. Ofosu, Aog 29 (2016) 1-8&lt;/code&gt; (the style currently used by uBiome SmartGut&amp;nbsp;reports).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is mesothelioma, how common is it, and who does it&amp;nbsp;affect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesothelioma is a rare cancer &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6608a3" title="Malignant Mesothelioma Mortality — United States, 1999–2015. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2017-03-03"&gt;responsible&lt;/a&gt; for taking the lives of approximately 3,000 people each year in the United States.
The disease affects people who have been exposed to asbestos in their day-to-day lives, whether that be through occupational exposure or other&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asbestos was commonly used in the construction of homes, schools and other buildings through the mid 1970s for its fire-resistant properties and, although it’s been decades since asbestos was used for building, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; products are &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/asbestos/us-federal-bans-asbestos#notbanned" title="U.S. Federal Bans on Asbestos. United States Environmental Protection Agency"&gt;still allowed&lt;/a&gt; to contain up to 1 percent of the toxin.
Exposure to and removal of asbestos can lead to the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.critrevonc.2012.03.001" title="The ticking time-bomb of asbestos: Its insidious role in the development of malignant mesothelioma. Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology. 2012-11"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; of mesothelioma cancer in the lungs (pleural), abdomen (peritoneal) or heart (pericardial), but symptoms can take 10–50 years to present&amp;nbsp;themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the prognosis and what factors determine disease&amp;nbsp;progression?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.maacenter.org/mesothelioma/prognosis/" title="MAACenter Mesothelioma Progrnosis Page"&gt;prognosis&lt;/a&gt; of mesothelioma varies depending on the type of diagnosis.
Both pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma have an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/2782590" title="Life Expectancy in Pleural and Peritoneal Mesothelioma. Lung Cancer International. 2017-01-23"&gt;average life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; of 6–12 months, while pericardial mesothelioma has an average life expectancy of 6 months.
Although there is no cure for mesothelioma yet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.17910" title="Biomarkers for early diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma: Do we need another moonshot? Oncotarget. 2017-05-17"&gt;early detection&lt;/a&gt; may allow for more options when it comes to treatment and ultimately improve survival rate and quality of&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is mesothelioma different from other&amp;nbsp;cancers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesothelioma is different from other cancers because it is an aggressive cancer, but it is also nearly 99 percent preventable.
Exposure to asbestos is the main cause of the disease, which is why a ban on asbestos in products would be so vital in the fight against&amp;nbsp;mesothelioma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What percent of mesothelioma cases result from asbestos&amp;nbsp;exposure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While asbestos is the cause of most mesothelioma cases, a naturally occurring mineral called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-53560-9_2" title="Asbestos and Fibrous Erionite. Asbestos and Mesothelioma. 2017-04-11"&gt;erionite&lt;/a&gt; has also been linked to the development of small amount of peritoneal mesothelioma&amp;nbsp;diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the dangers of asbestos, why has it been used in so many industrial applications?
Are there any worthwhile uses of asbestos or should it be altogether&amp;nbsp;banned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite deaths linked to asbestos beginning in the 1920s, it continued to be used in the construction of buildings due to its “miracle” properties, including the aforementioned fire-resistance, through the 1970s.
Unfortunately, any amount of exposure to asbestos could lead to mesothelioma, or another asbestos-related disease, which is why it is unsafe to have the toxin in any&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are some exciting research developments related to mesothelioma from the last five&amp;nbsp;years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immunotherapy&lt;/strong&gt; — In recent years, doctors have done clinical trials to see how immunotherapy affects several cancers, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr.2017.05.02" title="Immunotherapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma: current status and future directions. Translational Lung Cancer Research. 2017-06"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; mesothelioma.
Immunotherapy, the act of transferring T-cells, is designed to help the immune system recognize cancer cells that it otherwise wouldn’t have been able to.
It encourages antibodies to block the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PD&lt;/span&gt;-L1 protein so that T-cells can recognize it and fight it&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer Moonshot&lt;/strong&gt; — During its first year of operation, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629100506/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/node/352601"&gt;Cancer Moonshot&lt;/a&gt;’s mission has been clear: to make more therapies available and work on early detection.
This initiative puts a big focus on targeted immunotherapy, allowing more unique treatment options that fit a patient’s specific cancer.
Fortunately, with the approval from the National Cancer Institute, researchers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCI&lt;/span&gt; Cancer Centers have quick access to new drugs in hopes of finding effective treatments at a faster pace.
With this in mind, people diagnosed with less common cancers, such as mesothelioma, can have more faith in future treatment options as opposed to the limited treatments currently available.
As Cancer Moonshot pushes into its second year, it will be interesting to see where it takes the country in terms of advancing cancer treatment, early detection and&amp;nbsp;prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early detection&lt;/strong&gt; — or simply being aware of lung health by visiting a doctor for a lung screening — could be lifesaving when it comes to mesothelioma.
With the help of modern day science and the strides being made in research, the high rate of asbestos-related deaths may one day be a thing of the past, but for now, awareness is&amp;nbsp;key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Alison for the information.

Continuous analysis awakens with its &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3780" title="Brett Beaulieu-Jones &amp;amp; Casey Greene (2017) Reproducibility of computational workflows is automated using continuous analysis.

Any changes resulting from the update are tracked and&amp;nbsp;visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once properly configured, continuous analysis makes a computational study fully reproducible at every state throughout its history. It works by combining two technologies. First, &lt;strong&gt;continuous integration&lt;/strong&gt; monitors the source data and code for changes. If a change is detected, the study is re-executed by a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt; service such as &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.com/"&gt;Travis &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/"&gt;CircleCI&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://try.drone.io/"&gt;Drone&lt;/a&gt;. Second, to ensure the same computational environment is always available, &lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt; is used. &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; allows you to containerize a custom software environment, so anyone can run your analysis at any future&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for continuous analysis to enable reproducibility, the Docker image for a study must be publicly available. &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/"&gt;Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt; provides a convenient home for Docker images. However, for full reproducibility, images and containers should also be deposited to a persistent archive, such as figshare or Zenodo, under an open license, so they remain available in&amp;nbsp;perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you make a Docker image publicly available, you &lt;em&gt;distribute&lt;/em&gt; the containerized software. Accordingly, the right to redistribute software is a precondition for using it in reproducible computational workflows powered by continuous analysis. Unfortunately, copyright and licensing agreements often restrict distribution. The &lt;a href="http://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2014/03/10/the-whys-and-hows-of-licensing-scientific-code/" title="Jake VanderPlas (2014) The Whys and Hows of Licensing Scientific Code. AstroBetter"&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; is releasing software under a permissive open source license to allow redistribution and integration with other&amp;nbsp;codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current situation is dire. Many academics are unaware that copyright prevents distribution and reuse of their code, even after they&amp;#8217;ve posted it online and published a corresponding study. However, this post will focus on a different barrier to reproducibility: &lt;font style="font-variant: small-caps"&gt;Licensing offices at universities that fully comprehend legal restrictions on software reuse and explicitly choose to prevent redistribution.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these instances, universities require users of publicly funded software to enter into a licensing agreement. Copyright is no longer the primary obstacle to reuse, and fair use is no longer an alibi. Instead users are contractually bound to a custom license agreement. And few researchers have the legal background to appreciate the consequences. They simply register on a website, click agree, and subsequently overlook the legal baggage they&amp;#8217;ve now taken on to perform their research. I&amp;#8217;ll focus on two cases, but you&amp;#8217;re encouraged to comment on&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cibersort-of-stanford-university"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt; of Stanford&amp;nbsp;University&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cibersort.stanford.edu/" title="CIBERSORT HomePage at Stanford"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an R program for analyzing gene expression data. Since its 2015 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3337" title="Aaron Newman et al. (2015) Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles. Nature Methods"&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Methods&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s been cited 100 times. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt; program is made available, after registration and upon special request, under a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/dhimmel/58dcd9b512e669f20a65ddf73997b733" title="GitHub Gist of the CIBERSORT License"&gt;Stanford Non-commercial Software License Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. The title suggests this a standard license for Stanford, but Google doesn&amp;#8217;t pull up any other instances of its use. Here are some of the&amp;nbsp;specifics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RECIPIENT&lt;/span&gt; shall not distribute the Program or transfer it to any other person or organization without prior written permission from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STANFORD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, workflows using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt; are ineligible for reproducibility through continuous analysis as users are forbidden from distributing a Docker image. How about reimplementing the algorithm in Python, so you can get on with your containerization? With unlicensed software this would be a good option as copyright doesn&amp;#8217;t cover ideas. However, if you&amp;#8217;ve agreed to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt; license, reimplementing the algorithm is no longer an&amp;nbsp;option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RECIPIENT&lt;/span&gt; shall not reverse engineer, reverse assemble, reverse compile, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to create the source code for the Program. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RECIPIENT&lt;/span&gt; acknowledges that any programs created based on the Program will be considered a derivative of the Program and owned by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STANFORD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting aspects of continuous analysis is that whenever you change a piece of source code, you&amp;#8217;re automatically shown the consequences. But not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt; as&amp;nbsp;the:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RECIPIENT&lt;/span&gt; shall &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; make modifications to the&amp;nbsp;Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a major impediment as you&amp;#8217;re not allowed to enhance the software or even make bugfixes. So hypothetically, if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt; hardcoded its ν-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVM&lt;/span&gt; to only evaluate three regularization strengths, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t be allowed to add additional values to improve model fitting. And finally, don&amp;#8217;t try to do anything valuable with this publicly funded&amp;nbsp;software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RECIPIENT&lt;/span&gt; shall not use the Program for commercial advantage, or in the course of for-profit&amp;nbsp;activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not only is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt; license terrible for reproducibility, it&amp;#8217;s profoundly antiscientific. Yet, who funded the work? Three &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt; Grants. One &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOD&lt;/span&gt; grant. And several philanthropic foundations and charities including Doris Duke, Damon Runyon, B&amp;amp;J Cardon, Ludwig, and Thomas + Stacey&amp;nbsp;Siebel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gsea-of-the-broad-institute"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt; of the Broad&amp;nbsp;Institute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt;) is a Java program produced at the Broad Institute to help make biological sense of a list of genes. The software was originally described in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506580102" title="Aravind Subramanian et al. (2005) Gene set enrichment analysis: A knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences"&gt;2005 &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PNAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt; and later in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btm369" title="Aravind Subramanian et al. (2007) GSEA-P: a desktop application for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Bioinformatics"&gt;2007 &lt;em&gt;Bioinformatics&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt;. The program has been updated over time, most recently in October 2016. Together the two publications have amassed over 11 thousand&amp;nbsp;citations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp" title="GSEA HomePage at the Broad Institute"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt; website&lt;/a&gt; deceptively&amp;nbsp;states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please register to download the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt; software … Registration is free. Its only purpose is to help us track usage for reports to our funding&amp;nbsp;agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, &lt;a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/register.jsp?next=index.jsp" title="GSEA/MSigDB Registration and License Agreement"&gt;registration&lt;/a&gt; requires agreeing to the &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/dhimmel/04bfed6f618686ef53e050ba1191d917" title="GitHub Gist of the GSEA/MSigDB License Agreement"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology Single User License Agreement for Internal Research Purposes Only&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its generic title, this is a highly customized license that does not appear to be used anywhere&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accompanying the software is a database of gene sets called MSigDB, which is covered by the same license. In 2016, this license forced me to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d108#3" title="Daniel Himmelstein (2016) MSigDB licensing: Removing MSigDB from the Rephetio project. Thinklab"&gt;remove MSigDB&lt;/a&gt; from an integrative resource I was creating. This incident, along with others, was covered in the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; story titled &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/536016a" title="Simon Oxenham (2016) Legal confusion threatens to slow data science. Nature"&gt;legal confusion threatens to slow data science&lt;/a&gt;. Here we&amp;#8217;ll focus instead on how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s license prevents reproducible research using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, users are forbidden from sharing any Docker images containing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In no event shall &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LICENSEE&lt;/span&gt; sublicense or distribute, in whole or in part, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/span&gt;, modifications, [or] &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIXES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless without sharing the Docker image, a researcher could still benefit from continuous analysis. While not ideal for reproducibility, a private Docker image or encrypted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt; binary could be used in continuous integration to enable automatic re-execution and diffing of changes. But the license goes further and forbids convenient cloud services such as Travis &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt; or&amp;nbsp;CircleCI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LICENSEE&lt;/span&gt; agrees not to put the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/span&gt; or the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DATABASE&lt;/span&gt; on a network, server, or other similar technology that may be accessed by any individual other than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LICENSEE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt;, users take on restrictions that exceed copyright. Specifically, licensees are forbidden from reimplementing the software to make it more&amp;nbsp;open:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LICENSEE&lt;/span&gt; agrees that … the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/span&gt; … shall not be rewritten in another computer language or otherwise adapted to circumvent the need for obtaining a license for use of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/span&gt; or the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DATABASE&lt;/span&gt; other than as specified by this&amp;nbsp;Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous analysis strives to automate all downstream consequences of a change. However, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt; license imposes onerous and manual reporting&amp;nbsp;requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LICENSEE&lt;/span&gt; agrees to provide … a written evaluation of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROGRAM&lt;/span&gt; … Modifications and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIXES&lt;/span&gt; shall be provided to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; promptly upon their&amp;nbsp;creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt; team has &lt;a href="http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-CA121941-06A1"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; millions of dollars in funding from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt;, including the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCI&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIGMS&lt;/span&gt;, to develop their software and database. Join me in declaring it unacceptable for university licensing offices to hijack such major public&amp;nbsp;investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-do"&gt;What can you&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt;. Adopt an open source policy that requires all software to be released under an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSI&lt;/span&gt;-approved license. See &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-1040-y" title="Rafal Marszalek &amp;amp; Louisa Flintoft (2016) Being open: our policy on source code. Genome Biology"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genome Biology&lt;/em&gt;’s policy&lt;/a&gt; as an&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funder&lt;/strong&gt;. Mandate the open release of all software. Fund researchers with a track record of producing open source software. The nascent website &lt;a href="http://depsy.org/"&gt;Depsy&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/529115a" title="Dalmeet Chawla (2016) The unsung heroes of scientific software. Nature"&gt;help identify&lt;/a&gt; open source contributors. Also check that the researchers are already active on GitHub or other repository hosting&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University&lt;/strong&gt;. Stress the importance of open source to your Licensing Office. Ensure that your Licensing Office receives input from experts on reuse, such as librarians, not just experts on commercialization, liability, and &amp;#8220;technology&amp;nbsp;transfer&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researcher&lt;/strong&gt;. In most cases, your University owns the software you produce. Ideally, you can engineer a situation where you don&amp;#8217;t have to consult your University every time you want to openly license your software. The best method is committing to open licensing in your grant applications, thereby placing legally binding obligations on your University. See this blueprint &lt;a href="https://github.com/lab-carpentry/blueprint-resourcesharing/blob/master/examples/NIH-example.md" title="Lab Carpentry: NIH example for open licensing"&gt;resource sharing plan&lt;/a&gt; from Lab Carpentry, which we developed to prevent situations like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIBERSORT&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSEA&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@greenescientist/when-software-goes-missing-f6a0dffd68e5" title="Casey Greene (2016) When software goes missing. Medium"&gt;Xenome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even if the licensing of your software is up to the discretion of your University, there&amp;#8217;s still hope. Communicate to your Licensing Office the importance of open source licensing. Remember that should you change institutions or go the entrepreneurial route, your ability to freely use your past code will be contingent upon its open&amp;nbsp;licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="epilogue"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post focuses on the interplay between continuous analysis and petty software licensing by universities. However, many of the concepts apply more generally. The right to redistribute is the bedrock of reproducibility. While the absence of open licensing has harmed reproducibility in the past &amp;#8212; here&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href="http://gu.com/p/4dcx2/stw" title="Pete Etchells (2015) Replication frustration: what stops experiments being reliably repeated?

&lt;p&gt;New technologies like Docker that integrate hundreds of software products exacerbate licensing issues.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the paper&amp;#8217;s reliance on cryptography, both of the initial two reviews — by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5256/f1000research.8730.r12891"&gt;Amy Price&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5256/f1000research.8730.r13757"&gt;Luís Pinho-Costa&lt;/a&gt; — lacked any interrogation of the method&amp;#8217;s cryptography and approved the manuscript. Upon the second approval on May 11, 2016, the paper was deemed &amp;#8220;peer reviewed&amp;#8221; and &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-05/fo1-dub051116.php" title="Doctors use Bitcoin tech to improve transparency in clinical trial research.

The study has since been covered by &lt;a href="http://www.fiercebiotech.com/cro/doctors-use-bitcoin-tech-to-improve-transparency-trial-research" title="Doctors use bitcoin tech to improve transparency in trial research.

&lt;p&gt;However, it quickly became apparent that the paper &lt;a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2016/07/14/plagiarism-concerns-raised-over-popular-blockchain-paper-on-catching-misconduct/" title="Plagiarism concerns raised over popular blockchain paper on catching misconduct.

Curriculum vitae"&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; a PhD candidate at McGill University in the Biomedical Ethics&amp;nbsp;Unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.8114.2"&gt;Version 2&lt;/a&gt; of Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s study was posted on May 25, 2016, which attributes Carlisle&amp;#8217;s blog post and claims only to demonstrate the method. As noted by the &lt;em&gt;F1000Research&lt;/em&gt; editors, the Committee on Publication Ethics &lt;a href="http://publicationethics.org/case/what-extent-plagiarism-demands-retraction-vs-correction" title="What extent of plagiarism demands a retraction vs correction? COPE case number 16-11. 2016"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; a correction was sufficient to rectify the plagiarism. Hence, to this date, Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s study has not been&amp;nbsp;retracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will demonstrate that Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s problems aren&amp;#8217;t limited to plagiarism. In addition, their implementation of Carlisle&amp;#8217;s method is insecure and broken. Three aspects make Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s study a strong candidate for the most interesting case of scientific irreproducibility&amp;nbsp;ever:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the study is 100% reproducible, the proposed implementation for timestamping clinical trials is wholly bankrupt. Unlike most scientific protocols which are not required to operate perfectly 100% of the time, timestamping assumes complete reproducibility and is worthless without&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden claim a &amp;#8220;second researcher&amp;#8221; replicated their &lt;em&gt;address generation&lt;/em&gt;. If so, the second researcher should be able to demonstrate the replication, which is subject to the laws of mathematics and therefore cannot be forged. Thus, Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden are now in a position to cryptographically prove the reproducibility of their analysis, thereby exonerating their study from any claim of scientific&amp;nbsp;misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden have left, presumably unwittingly, a 40 millibit bounty (worth approximately $50 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) to reproduce their analysis. The longer this bounty remains unclaimed, the greater the evidence of the study&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;irreproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="proof-of-existence"&gt;Proof of&amp;nbsp;existence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we&amp;#8217;ll use the terms &lt;em&gt;proof of existence&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;timestamping&lt;/em&gt; to refer to irrefutable evidence that digital content (e.g. a document) existed at a certain point in time. Proof of existence alone&amp;nbsp;cannot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prove that content did not exist prior to its&amp;nbsp;timestamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prove who authored&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prove that alternative versions of content did not exist and were not also&amp;nbsp;timestamped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So proof of existence can attest that a clinical trial protocol existed at a certain past date. However, it falls short of the application proposed by Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden to &amp;#8220;provide proof of pre-specified endpoints in clinical trial protocols.&amp;#8221; This is because their approach fails to prove clinical trial authorship and that multiple &amp;#8220;pre-specified endpoints&amp;#8221; did not&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Bitcoin blockchain is the most immutable database in existence, it is the natural choice for indefinitely and publicly storing data. Using bitcoin, you can make your data impervious to tampering, censorship, or deletion. However, you can only directly store very small amounts of data using Bitcoin. Therefore, proof of existence relies on encoding a file&amp;#8217;s hash into the blockchain rather than the entire file itself. A hash is a compact fixed-length sequence of characters that provides a unique fingerprint for a piece of content. Carlisle and Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA&lt;/span&gt;-256 hash, which is considered a secure hash and checksum, since it&amp;#8217;s physically impossible with current technology to generate two pieces of content that produce the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA&lt;/span&gt;-256&amp;nbsp;hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="existing-implementations"&gt;Existing&amp;nbsp;Implementations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s study there were dozens of existing tools to create Bitcoin-verifiable timestamps. For example, in March 2015 a &lt;a href="https://redd.it/30ndi6"&gt;Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; compiled a &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/VpFT3e"&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; of 15 timestamping services. There are two primary methods for encoding hashes in the&amp;nbsp;blockchain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the hash to generate a bitcoin address. Send a miniscule amount of bitcoin to the minted address to prove the address (and hence the hash that generated it) existed at a certain point in&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a bitcoin transaction that encodes the hash using &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170718113622/https://21.co/learn/embedding-data-blockchain-op-return/#embedding-data-in-the-blockchain-with-op_return" title="Embedding data in the blockchain with OP_RETURN"&gt;&lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a field for attaching arbitrary data to a bitcoin&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlisle&amp;#8217;s blog post uses the first method, address generation. Personally, I&amp;#8217;ve timestamped scientific outputs using two&amp;nbsp;existing &lt;code&gt;OP_RETURN&lt;/code&gt; solutions. On August 14, 2015, I used &lt;a href="https://proofofexistence.com"&gt;proofofexistence.com&lt;/a&gt; to timestamp a pre-release version of Hetionet (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d102"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/092f81abd7bb5c59e52e2d8e794de6cee4a1cd701f7a87d2bc11cfefe97d4923?show_adv=true"&gt;transaction&lt;/a&gt;). And on March 3, 2017, I &lt;a href="https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/pull/274"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://opentimestamps.org/"&gt;OpenTimestamps&lt;/a&gt; integration to the Deep Review, a collaborative review article. Every time the Deep Review &lt;a href="https://greenelab.github.io/deep-review/"&gt;manuscript&lt;/a&gt; is changed, it&amp;#8217;s automatically timestamped. OpenTimestamps, along with other newer methods like &lt;a href="https://originstamp.org"&gt;OriginStamp&lt;/a&gt;, combines multiple input hashes before writing to the blockchain. This innovation makes timestamping with bitcoin more economical and&amp;nbsp;scalable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden seem unaware of these existing implementations and the larger study of cryptocurrency. They fail to cite prior work, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-38424-3_32" title="Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta. How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document. Advances in Cryptology. 1990"&gt;digital timestamping&lt;/a&gt;, Bitcoin&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" title="Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. October 31, 2008"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04015" title="Bela Gipp, Norman Meuschke, André Gernandt. Decentralized Trusted Timestamping using the Crypto Currency Bitcoin. February 13, 2015"&gt;OriginStamp&lt;/a&gt;. Most fatally however, they created their own manual implementation of address generation, rather than relying on existing single-step&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-carlisle-method"&gt;The Carlisle&amp;nbsp;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Gregory Carlisle&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.bgcarlisle.com/blog/2014/08/25/proof-of-prespecified-endpoints-in-medical-research-with-the-bitcoin-blockchain/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from August 25, 2014 suggests using an address generation method to timestamp clinical trial protocols. This method can be decomposed into three&amp;nbsp;steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA&lt;/span&gt;-256 hash of a&amp;nbsp;document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the hash as a bitcoin private key and generate the corresponding bitcoin&amp;nbsp;address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send bitcoin to the address. The confirmed transaction proves the document&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;existence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlisle&amp;#8217;s post is thoughtful and presents its limitations fairly. However, a reference implementation is not provided. At the present time, cryptocurrency is confusing. I encourage everyone to play with it, at their own risk. But I &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; encourage novices to implement security critical applications and advertise those applications without extensive review from seasoned computer&amp;nbsp;scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden created a Microsoft Word document (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5256/f1000research.8114.d114596"&gt;supplement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets/8114/9c9f9a18-a852-40c6-953e-c75107abc714_Appendix_1_-_unformatted_text_file_.docx"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;) which they &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@OmnesRes/medical-students-cant-help-but-plagiarize-apparently-f81074824c17" title="Jordan Anaya. Medical students can’t help but plagiarize, apparently. Medium. July 21, 2016"&gt;erroneously&lt;/a&gt; refer to as an &amp;#8220;unformatted text file.&amp;#8221; Applying Carlisle&amp;#8217;s method to this document (see this &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/irreproducible-timestamps/blob/master/addresses.ipynb"&gt;Jupyter notebook for a Python implementation&lt;/a&gt;), we get the following &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA&lt;/span&gt;-256 hash (private key): &lt;small&gt;&lt;code&gt;8da3088936035521f9e9b57963679d89e306a06c6aebd1167b4d198e79562326&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;. There are two methods to go from a hex encoded private key to a bitcoin address. Neither Carlisle nor Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden specify which method they use. If we use an &lt;em&gt;uncompressed&lt;/em&gt; public key, we get the bitcoin address of &lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1P6cxmuSsjDqUGCsyaEzgcj7iTEPsMAjhU"&gt;&lt;code&gt;1P6cxmuSsjDqUGCsyaEzgcj7iTEPsMAjhU&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;. If we instead use a &lt;em&gt;compressed&lt;/em&gt; public key, we get &lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/17pJjJGJJTzVsJx9JSfbx6vp1sGkPNoDoA"&gt;&lt;code&gt;17pJjJGJJTzVsJx9JSfbx6vp1sGkPNoDoA&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;. Neither of these addresses have been used, indicating that Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden did not properly timestamp their Word document according to Carlisle&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="irving-holdens-intended-implementation"&gt;Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s Intended&amp;nbsp;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden describe their implementation of Carlisle&amp;#8217;s method as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href="http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator"&gt;Xorbin&lt;/a&gt; website to compute the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA&lt;/span&gt;-256 hash of the clinical trial protocol. Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden do not disclose this&amp;nbsp;hash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://strongcoin.com/"&gt;StrongCoin&lt;/a&gt; online bitcoin wallet to generate an address using the Xorbin-generated hash as a private key. Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden specify this address to be &lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1AHjCz2oEUTH8js4S8vViC8NKph4zCACXH"&gt;&lt;code&gt;1AHjCz2oEUTH8js4S8vViC8NKph4zCACXH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send bitcoin to the the address. Currently, the disclosed address has a single &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/tx/6a6fe5df3fe8ef3ed04582885ad8f50177a446ffe7fc87a8fcc4b8be6f155a8d"&gt;transaction&lt;/a&gt; that deposited 40 millibits on February 11, 2016. At that time, 40 millibits was worth approximately $15 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. These funds were never withdrawn and are now worth close to&amp;nbsp;$50.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were this approach to properly implement Carlisle&amp;#8217;s method, it would be riddled with vulnerabilities. It requires trusting Xorbin and an insecure (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;) internet connection to Xorbin. It requires trusting StrongCoin. If either service has a bug, it requires confidence that these services will continue to be available in the future without fixing the bug. Neither Xorbin nor StrongCoin are open source projects and are thus difficult to preserve and lack community code&amp;nbsp;review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s ample room for malicious attacks. Xorbin or a man-in-the-middle could record private keys and monitor the blockchain for transactions to the corresponding addresses. Funds could then be withdrawn by the attacker before the user got around to transferring them to a secure address. When using address generation for timestamping, users should send only a miniscule amount of bitcoin to the address. So a more devastating attack would produce an incorrect hash, depriving users from subsequently proving their document&amp;#8217;s existence. In the high-stakes pharmaceutical industry, billions of dollars could ride on whether a timestamp verifies. Furthermore, an attacker could timestamp a modified protocol and, at a later date, frame the original author for unethical changes to the clinical&amp;nbsp;trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we know that Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden did not properly execute Carlisle&amp;#8217;s method. So let&amp;#8217;s not dwell on the vulnerabilities of their intended&amp;nbsp;implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="irving-holdens-broken-implementation"&gt;Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s Broken&amp;nbsp;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s implementation of Carlisle&amp;#8217;s method appears broken for both steps 1 &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Xorbin only accepts plain text input for computing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA&lt;/span&gt;-256 hashes. Xorbin does not allow users to upload a file indicating that Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden pasted formatted text from a Word documented into Xorbin&amp;#8217;s plain text&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversion from formatted to plain text is nondeterministic and depends on the specific system environment and text selection method. Did Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden select all&amp;nbsp;(&lt;code&gt;⎈&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;⌘&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;) or drag the cursor when copying the text? How did the table get downgraded to plain text? How were newlines&amp;nbsp;represented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pasting formatted text into a plain text field is a terrible design decision. Nonetheless, under the same conditions, one could replicate the pasting behavior and hence the hash generation of Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Holden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden erroneously assume that &amp;#8220;account password&amp;#8221; in the StrongCoin wallet is equivalent to &amp;#8220;private key&amp;#8221;. Instead as far as I can tell, each account on StrongCoin is a bitcoin address with a randomly generated private key. The account password is used for client-side encryption of the private key, but is not itself a private key. To demonstrate that the account password is not a private key, I generated two accounts that both use the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA&lt;/span&gt;-256 hash for their&amp;nbsp;password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="StrongCoin Paper Wallet" src="https://github.com/dhimmel/irreproducible-timestamps/raw/master/strongcoin/paper-wallet-06-03-2017-191921.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the two accounts have different addresses. Therefore, the private key → address conversion of Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden is irreparably broken. Since nothing that must derive from the account password ever gets incorporated into the blockchain, there is no proof that Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s protocol ever&amp;nbsp;existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s timestamp is irreproducible. There is no way to prove the past existence of their clinical trial protocol from publicly available&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the evidence herein that their address generation cannot be reproduced, Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden make the following&amp;nbsp;claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To verify the existence of the document a second researcher was sent the originally prepared unformatted document. An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA256&lt;/span&gt; digest was created as previously described and a corresponding private key, public key and bitcoin address generated. The exact replication of the bitcoin address (&lt;small&gt;&lt;code&gt;1AHjCz2oEUTH8js4S8vViC8NKph4zCACXH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) was then used to prove the documents existence in the blockchain using&amp;nbsp;blockchain.info©.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not think a second researcher could have reproduced the address generation, since StrongCoin generates a random private key, in lieu of using the protocol hash as the private&amp;nbsp;key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of cryptography is that it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter what I think. If Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s statement is true, they or the &amp;#8220;second researcher&amp;#8221; will be able to provide the exact chain of operations to go from clinical trial protocol to public key. And anyone will be able to independently verify their&amp;nbsp;proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is currently a bounty to reproduce Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s address generation. This bounty was publicly disclosed over a year ago with the initial posting of their study and remains unclaimed. Note that Irving/Holden and StrongCoin should both possess enough information to move the funds from &lt;small&gt;&lt;code&gt;1AHjCz2oEUTH8js4S8vViC8NKph4zCACXH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;. Therefore, withdrawal is insufficient to prove the protocol&amp;#8217;s existence. But the continued lack of withdrawal is evidence that no third party can reproduce their&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past attempts to reproduce scientific studies have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/541269a" title="Monya Baker &amp;amp; Elie Dolgin. Cancer reproducibility project releases first results. Nature News. January 18, 2017"&gt;notoriously inconclusive&lt;/a&gt;. Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s timestamp is notedly different in that its replicability is unambiguous. It will or will not provably replicate. There is no in between. So in a perverse way, this incident gives us a glimpse into a more reproducible&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id="update-on-march-30-2017"&gt;Update on March 30,&amp;nbsp;2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden posted &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.8114.3"&gt;version 3&lt;/a&gt; of their study to &lt;em&gt;F1000Research&lt;/em&gt;. The updated study now claims have verified the clinical trial protocol timestamp&amp;nbsp;by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;logging into the same StrongCoin account that generated the bitcoin address &lt;small&gt;&lt;code&gt;1AHjCz2oEUTH8js4S8vViC8NKph4zCACXH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;decrypting the corresponding private key using the protocol&amp;#8217;s hash as the account&amp;nbsp;password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden have conceded that their protocol&amp;#8217;s hash was used as an account password. Wallet passwords are entirely off-chain; they are never written to the Bitcoin blockchain. In other words, there is no timestamp of Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s protocol. Game&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I&amp;#8217;m tempted to ask Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden for their StrongCoin login (email &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; password), so I can &amp;#8220;verify&amp;#8221; that their protocol&amp;#8217;s hash decrypts their address&amp;#8217;s private key — also known as claiming my damn&amp;nbsp;bounty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Benjamin Carlisle for contributing diffs showing the revisions between versions &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/irreproducible-timestamps/blob/37f66dc39bab650671d1d05e510199705c59248b/f1000/v2-3.pdf" title="PDF of the diff between Irving &amp;amp; Holden v2 and v3"&gt;2–3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/irreproducible-timestamps/blob/37f66dc39bab650671d1d05e510199705c59248b/f1000/v1-2.pdf" title="PDF of the diff between Irving &amp;amp; Holden v1 and v2"&gt;1–2&lt;/a&gt;. Note that version 3 also switches to using a text file rather than a Word Document to store the protocol. I &lt;a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dhimmel/irreproducible-timestamps/blob/37f66dc39bab650671d1d05e510199705c59248b/addresses.ipynb#Update-for-protocol-for-manuscript-version-3"&gt;generated&lt;/a&gt; addresses using Carlisle&amp;#8217;s method for the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA&lt;/span&gt;-256 hash. However, reproducing Irving &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Holden&amp;#8217;s hash is irrelevant (unless you have access to their StrongCoin&amp;nbsp;account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="update-on-may-26-2017"&gt;Update on May 26,&amp;nbsp;2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;F1000Research&lt;/em&gt; announced on May 24 that the study will be retracted, &lt;a href="http://retractionwatch.com/2017/05/24/authors-retract-much-debated-blockchain-paper-f1000/" title="Authors retract much-debated blockchain paper from F1000.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors have taken this decision after considering the methodological concerns raised by a peer reviewer during the post-publication open peer review process. As the methodology has been deemed to be unreliable, the article is now&amp;nbsp;retracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, since my last blog post on preprints at the beginning of 2016, &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; has grown by 149% from 2,785 to 6,933 preprints. The growth has been fueled largely by the efforts of &lt;a href="http://asapbio.org/" title="A scientist-driven initiative to promote the productive use of preprints in the life sciences"&gt;ASAPbio&lt;/a&gt; and the growing recognition that &lt;a href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/history-of-delays/" title="The history of publishing delays"&gt;publishing delays&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/530148a" title="Does it take too long to publish research?"&gt;interfering with science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; requires that all preprints are published under a Creative Commons Attribution (&lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) License, &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; allows authors to choose from five options: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Attribution-NoDerivatives)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Attribution-NonCommercial)&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives)&lt;/small&gt;, and no license &lt;small&gt;(all rights reserved)&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Creative Commons licenses is to allow the reuse of content that would otherwise be prohibited by copyright. As a result, the open licensing of preprints is crucial for the growth of open access, the movement to make publicly-funded research articles available to and reusable by the&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="license-breakdown"&gt;License&amp;nbsp;breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, of the five options offered by &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; is the only &lt;a href="https://opendefinition.org/licenses/" title="Open Definition Conformant Licenses"&gt;open license&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://opendefinition.org/" title="The Open Definition sets out principles that define “openness” in relation to data and content"&gt;requires&lt;/a&gt; that content &amp;#8220;can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.&amp;#8221; Therefore, with the help of Jordan Anaya, I looked into which licensing options authors were choosing for their &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprints (till the end of November 2016). The breakdown shows that there&amp;#8217;s major room for improvement &lt;small&gt;(&lt;a href="#license-implications"&gt;see why license choices matter below&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="license-table"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;License&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Count&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Percent&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Score&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1,237&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;17.8%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;496&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7.2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;586&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8.5%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;29.7%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id="licenses-over-time"&gt;Licenses over&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I looked to see whether &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprints were becoming more open over time. They weren&amp;#8217;t. In fact, the proportion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; licenses has been in decline since mid&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="date-figure"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="licenses-by-subject"&gt;Licenses by&amp;nbsp;subject&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about licensing by discipline? The figure below shows all subjects with at least 100 preprints. Bioinformatics appears to be the most open, whereas Cell Biology is the least&amp;nbsp;open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="subject-figure"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-biorxiv-leaderboard"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;leaderboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the scoring system &lt;a href="#license-table"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;, I assigned each preprint a score based on its license. Each author received a score equaling the sum of their&amp;nbsp;preprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle initials were removed to consolidate duplicate names for the same person. If you&amp;#8217;re worried that this analysis conflates multiple authors with the same name, start using &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/" title="Persistent digital identifiers for every researcher"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ORCID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, with only 29,436 distinct author names, name collisions are yet to be a major&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id="author-table" class="display" cellspacing="0" width="100%"&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/mark-daly" title="Mark Daly at the Broad Institute"&gt;Mark Daly&lt;/a&gt; of the Broad Institute for leading both in terms of number of preprints and score. Also notable was &lt;a href="http://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html" title="Bloom Lab at Fred Hutch"&gt;Jesse Bloom&lt;/a&gt; of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who&amp;#8217;s posted 10 preprints, all under &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;. Condolences to my advisor, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118014834/http://www.greenelab.com/casey" title="Casey Greene · Greene Lab at the University of Pennsylvania"&gt;Casey Greene&lt;/a&gt;, whose unfortunate decision to post &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/051524" title="Pathway and network-based strategies to translate genetic discoveries into effective therapies"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of his 11 &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprints under all rights reserved kept him out of the top&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="license-implications"&gt;License&amp;nbsp;implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are only a paltry 17.8% of &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprints openly licensed? Perhaps many authors are unaware of the implications of their&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it&amp;#8217;s important to note that these licenses affect copyright, which only covers the original works of authorship in the preprint, such as writing and figures. The licenses do not affect whether others can use the knowledge or inventions presented in the preprint. If you want to prevent others from using your discoveries, you&amp;#8217;ll need a&amp;nbsp;patent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, many preprints go on to be published in subscription journals where authors transfer copyright or grant the journal an exclusive license to publish. In essence, they forfeit their copyrights. As a consequence, openly licensing your preprint is the best way to ensure that &lt;em&gt;you yourself&lt;/em&gt; retain the right to reuse&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, most researchers care about getting citations and preventing plagiarism. However, the Attribution clause (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;) of Creative Commons Licenses is sufficient, which is &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" title="Human-readable summary of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International"&gt;summarized as&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ND&lt;/span&gt; stipulations provide no additional protection against plagiarism. And anyways, scholarly norms rather than threats of being sued are what &lt;a href="https://dancohen.org/2013/11/26/cc0-by/" title="Dan Cohen Blog · CC0 (+BY)"&gt;actually encourages&lt;/a&gt; attribution. If you want to maximize citations, choose the license that allows for maximum&amp;nbsp;dissemination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="all-rights-reserved"&gt;All rights&amp;nbsp;reserved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;29.8% of &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprints are all rights reserved, placing a large portion of the &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; corpus in the same troublesome legal situation as traditional academic&amp;nbsp;publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copying or distributing these preprints is copyright infringement, exposing well-intentioned scientists to legal peril. Diego Gomez —  who was a master&amp;#8217;s student in Colombia 🇨🇴 — &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/colombian-grad-student-faces-jail-sharing-thesis-online" title="Colombian grad student faces jail for sharing a thesis online"&gt;learned this the hard way&lt;/a&gt;, when in 2011 he posted a thesis on Scribd to share with colleagues. Now Deigo&amp;#8217;s legal nightmare has lasted for more than two years, and he&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/over-two-years-later-diego-gomezs-ongoing-case-shows-need-global-reforms" title="Over Two Years Later, Diego Gomez’s Ongoing Case Shows the Need for Global Reforms"&gt;still facing&lt;/a&gt; the potential of a 4–8 year jail&amp;nbsp;sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in almost all cases, it&amp;#8217;s in the researcher&amp;#8217;s best interest to license their preprints. The benefits for the preprint are many, including decreasing the friction for: other scientists to share, disseminate, or present it; search engines to index and display it; and text mining corpuses to include&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; cease to exist, preserving these unlicensed preprints would be fraught with risk. Who wants to look back in their elder years to see their past research &lt;a href="https://oadoi.org/10.1111/jels.12057" title="How Copyright Keeps Works Disappeared"&gt;disappeared&lt;/a&gt;? And in the case of publicly-funded research, there&amp;#8217;s an ethical imperative to make it freely available and&amp;nbsp;reusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="non-commercial"&gt;Non-commercial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;75.0% of &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprints forbid commercial use. Unfortunately, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.150.2189" title="Creative Commons licenses and the non-commercial condition: Implications for the re-use of biodiversity information"&gt;ambiguity&lt;/a&gt; of what qualifies as commercial dissuades potential users. But commercial use is awesome — it means that someone has found a way to add enough value to your work that others will pay for it. And unless you plan on selling your preprint, there&amp;#8217;s zero opportunity&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re quickly entering an era where scientific literature is read first by a computer, and then second, if at all, by a human. As &lt;a href="http://chjh.nl/" title="Chris Hartgerink's Homepage"&gt;Chris Hartgerink&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/527413f" title="Text-mining block prompts online response"&gt;a text miner&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 who purchased legal insurance during his PhD — explains, &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt; restricts the value of text and data mining outputs by limiting the potential applications of the&amp;nbsp;method.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="no-derivatives"&gt;No&amp;nbsp;derivatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;73.7% of &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprints forbid derivatives. A derivative could be that someone likes your figure and wants to modify it. Or someone wants to translate your preprint into a different language. Even more so than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ND&lt;/span&gt; stipulations are &lt;a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Wiki/cc_license_compatibility" title="Creative Commons License Compatibility"&gt;incompatible&lt;/a&gt; with other licenses, making it difficult to remix or combine&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-can-i-do"&gt;What can I&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; in the future. If you&amp;#8217;ve posted any preprints that aren&amp;#8217;t &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;, you can submit a revision on &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; to update the license (assuming that you still own the rights and the work hasn&amp;#8217;t been published by a&amp;nbsp;journal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re worried about some nebulous risk to open licensing, just remember that there are already &lt;a href="https://stateof.creativecommons.org/2015/" title="State of the Commons 2015"&gt;over a quarter billion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; licensed works. &lt;small&gt;Note that if your preprint includes content that you don&amp;#8217;t own the rights to and that isn&amp;#8217;t compatibly licensed, you&amp;#8217;ll have to seek permission or take a wager on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use" title="Wikipedia · Fair use"&gt;fair use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funders:&lt;/strong&gt; Require open! See the Gates Foundation&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Open-Access-Policy" title="Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Open Access Policy"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; as an&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preprint Servers:&lt;/strong&gt; Remove the all rights reserved option. Consider replacing it with &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;small&gt;(Public Domain Dedication)&lt;/small&gt;, which is ideal for preprints by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Government employees 🇺🇸, whose work is not subject to copyright under &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; law but would &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/2014/05/09/white-house-supports-cc0-for-federal-government-datasets/" title="White House supports CC0 for federal government datasets"&gt;still benefit&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC0&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers:&lt;/strong&gt; Check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/biorxiv-licenses" title="dhimmel/biorxiv-licenses · GitHub"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for this post or play with &lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/repo/dhimmel/biorxiv-licenses" title="mybinder.org · Launch dhimmel/biorxiv-licenses in your browser using Jupyter"&gt;the binder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints are an exciting development in scholarly communication. Now let&amp;#8217;s start off down the right&amp;nbsp;track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update on March 29, 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; Jessica Polka, Director of ASAPbio, &lt;a href="#comment-3215911237"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; reordered their license options so the more open licenses now appear first (as I suggested in the comments below). Accordingly, I &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/biorxiv-licenses/blob/16cdfccef4ac1fb30cfb3de784b686659ce1de52/3.impact.ipynb" title="Jupyter notebook on GitHub: bioRxiv license choices, before &amp;amp; after the blog post"&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; the distribution of licenses for the 100 days preceding this blog post to the 100 days following this blog post. The proportion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; licenses increased from 13.7% to 21.1% (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 1.67 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;). Based on this effect, I estimate this blog post led to &lt;strong&gt;153 additional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; preprints&lt;/strong&gt; in the 100 days following its&amp;nbsp;publication!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update on June 16, 2017:&lt;/strong&gt; ASAPbio just &lt;a href="http://asapbio.org/licensing" title="ASAPbio launches preprint licensing task force. 2017-06-16"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; they&amp;#8217;re launching a licensing taskforce, which I&amp;#8217;m excited to be part of. &lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2017.22161" title="Lindsay McKenzie. Biologists debate how to license preprints. Nature News. 2017-06-16"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; this development and the broader issue. The leaderboard above helped identify preprint authors Jesse Bloom and Giulio Caravagna, who were both interviewed by &lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update on October 5, 2018:&lt;/strong&gt; ASAPbio has &lt;a href="http://asapbio.org/new-licensing-resources" title="Sharing New Educational Resources on Open Licensing for Preprints"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="http://asapbio.org/licensing-faq"&gt;Preprint Licensing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a must-read resource for anyone interested in the intricacies of how Creative Commons licenses apply to preprints. This resource was drafted and reviewed by a diverse group of experts and stakeholders including lawyers and publishers. It touches on many of the most challenging questions related to open licensing in publishing, with top-notch legal&amp;nbsp;reasoning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the seminar, the Baranzini Lab organized a reception. The reception was home to my PhD Exhibit. As per tradition, PhD Exhibits showcase items and achievements from one&amp;#8217;s dissertation. My exhibit consisted of the following 11 items and labels, adapted for the &lt;em&gt;Satoshi Village&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-emrakul-the-aeons-torn"&gt;1. Emrakul, the Aeons&amp;nbsp;Torn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 1" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-01.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emrakul, the Aeons Torn&lt;/em&gt; is an artifact from Daniel&amp;#8217;s first-year affair with &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;. Daniel had played Magic prior to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt;, including at summer camp and the Moore Lab at Dartmouth. The first year graduate program was the perfect combo to reignite Daniel&amp;#8217;s interest in Magic. First, many of his classmates had played. Second, &lt;em&gt;Systems&lt;/em&gt; — a team-based intensive course — exacerbated Daniel&amp;#8217;s online shopping habit. So on October 28, 2011, Daniel obtained &lt;em&gt;Emrakul, the Aeons Torn&lt;/em&gt; from eBay. After receiving the card, Daniel learned that it didn&amp;#8217;t work in his deck because it was a legendary creature rather than an&amp;nbsp;artifact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2-pong-paddle"&gt;2. Pong &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Paddle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 2" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-02.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pong is a game which combines the best elements of table tennis and beer drinking. However, due to its steep learning curve and specialized equipment, pong has not caught on outside of a few select communities. In August 2012, Daniel traveled to Newark, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; where he paid $125.06 for a ¾″ × 5′ × 9′ sheet of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACX&lt;/span&gt; plywood. After preparation, paint, and positioning atop two 44-gallon yellow Rubbermaid Brutes, a pong table was born. During the 2012–13 academic year, the table saw action more nights than not. Usually, Daniel played against his roommate Kamen: the isolation of Crestmont Drive necessitated one-on-one competition compared to the customary two-on-two. On display is one of the original four paddles christened alongside the table. The Grate Stuff patina and Cabernet Sauvignon staining make this paddle the most exquisite of the&amp;nbsp;quartet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3-dipper"&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Dipper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 3" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On display is dipper — Daniel&amp;#8217;s PhD Workstation. During his first year in the Baranzini Lab, Daniel researched using littledipper, a machine he built during his senior year of college at Cornell. However, after Daniel passed his Qualifying Exam in June 2013, Sergio graciously commissioned the construction of dipper. Dipper boasts 16 3.2-GHz cores, 256 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; of memory, and 4.25 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TB&lt;/span&gt; of storage (4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TB&lt;/span&gt; on hard disk and 256 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; on solid state). The two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt; Opteron 6328 processors delivered a great price–performance ratio, but Daniel&amp;#8217;s colleague Antoine would always lament the lack of Intel inside. Daniel also thanks &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s defunct Graduate Student Research Award for funding the acquisition of 192 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; of the random access memory. Dipper is on loan&amp;nbsp;from &lt;code&gt;dipper.ucsf.edu&lt;/code&gt; for the duration of this&amp;nbsp;exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4-mission-bay-fire"&gt;4. Mission Bay&amp;nbsp;Fire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 4" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-04.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;#8217;s time at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; has been a time of growth, both for Daniel as a scientist and for the surrounding Mission Bay neighborhood. Nonetheless, a few instances of great destruction occurred during his doctorate. One such incident was the Mission Bay Fire of March 11, 2014, where an under-construction apartment complex went up in flames to the tune of $50 million in damage. The Sandler Neurosciences Center stood due south of the engulfed property with no buildings obscuring the sightline. By nightfall, Sandler was deeply impregnated with fumes from the conflagration. On display are certified remains of 1200 Fourth Street from a limited edition of three samples. Sample one belongs to John Witte — thesis committee member and rotation advisor of Daniel — who won it at a his lab&amp;#8217;s white elephant gift&amp;nbsp;exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5-the-phd-plant"&gt;5. The PhD&amp;nbsp;Plant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 5" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-05.jpg" title="Daniel's PhD Plant is pictured with Isabelle Feldhaus at The Exhibit. The poor health of the plant is disguised with posterization."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On display is Daniel&amp;#8217;s PhD Plant. When a student takes on a PhD Plant, their primary doctoral obligation becomes graduating before the plant perishes. Daniel has been cultivating this abutilon since April 2014. Over the years he added grass and replanted it, although he deeply regrets not having started it from seed on September 1, 2011 — the first day of his PhD. Daniel thanks his labmate Egle for caring for the plant in his absence. Upon leaving, Daniel is expected to give the plant to&amp;nbsp;Egle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6-biomedical-computation-review"&gt;6. Biomedical Computation&amp;nbsp;Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 6" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-06.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel spent years two and three of his doctorate working on a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259" title="Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; with Sergio to predict disease–gene associations. In his third year, Daniel presented his findings at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BCATS&lt;/span&gt; — a trainee symposium at Stanford — where Kristin Sainini witnessed his talk. She went on to write a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160330020546/http://biomedicalcomputationreview.org/content/unlocking-genetics-complex-diseases-gwas-and-beyond" title="Unlocking the Genetics of Complex Diseases: GWAS and Beyond"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GWAS&lt;/span&gt; and Beyond that appeared in the Winter 2014/2015 edition of the &lt;em&gt;Biomedical Computation Review&lt;/em&gt; on display. Daniel felt honored to have his pre-publication research described alongside the luminaries of human&amp;nbsp;genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7-the-lung"&gt;7. The&amp;nbsp;Lung&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 7" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-07.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was over a game of pong that Kamen first mentioned his theory that oxygen causes lung cancer to Daniel. The two began a collaboration looking at how lung cancer varied with altitude. Codenamed the lung, the study found less lung cancer at high altitude where the air contains less oxygen. The study was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705" title="Lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation: evidence for oxygen as an inhaled carcinogen"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; — the best journal of that time — and was later the focus of a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article on display. The study currently has an &lt;a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/3060395"&gt;Altmetric score&lt;/a&gt; of 414 (99.9th percentile), but the path wasn&amp;#8217;t all smooth sailing. &lt;em&gt;Cancer Research &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2015/01/14/does-oxygen-cause-lung-cancer-i-wouldnt-hold-your-breath/" title="Does oxygen cause lung cancer? I wouldn’t hold your breath"&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; the study and acclaimed science journalist Ed Yong &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209/status/555532584214884353" title="Tweet by Ed Yong"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;a really strong early contender for Worst Study of&amp;nbsp;2015.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8-the-elk-skull"&gt;8. The Elk&amp;nbsp;Skull&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 8" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-08.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Independence Day 2015, Daniel descended Vail Mountain via the Minturn Mile trail. Midway through the hike, a skull was spotted protruding from the topsoil. Daniel brought the cow elk skull back to San Francisco, where he began the several-month process of cleaning the specimen. The cleaning protocol called for subtilisins, a type of proteolytic enzyme that occurs in premium laundry detergents such as Arm &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Hammer. Three decades earlier, it was Jim Wells — now a Professor at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; — who began engineering subtilisins and paved the way for their current industrial&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9-death-to-the-delay"&gt;9. Death to the&amp;nbsp;Delay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 9" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-09.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel&amp;#8217;s study had been accepted, but was, after two months, still not published. He grew frustrated by the holdup and began researching delays for other papers at the same journal. The research led him to compare delays at 16 journals in his field. He found the journal where his paper had been accepted took the longest to publish. The &lt;a href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/plos-and-publishing-delays/" title="Publication delays at PLOS and 3,475 other journals"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; received hundreds of Tweets and was promptly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/523131f" title="Long wait for publication plagues many journals"&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;. The print summary from the 9 July 2015 edition of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; is on display. Later &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; contacted Daniel regarding a more in depth piece on publishing delays. This served as the impetus for Daniel to &lt;a href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/history-of-delays/" title="The history of publishing delays"&gt;explore&lt;/a&gt; the history of delays. He found that journal-reported acceptance delays haven&amp;#8217;t increased over time. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/530148a" title="Does it take too long to publish research?"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the 11 February 2016 edition of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on&amp;nbsp;display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="10-the-decision-letter"&gt;10. The Decision&amp;nbsp;Letter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 10" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-10.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 was a year of great indecision for Daniel. What to do after graduating perplexed him more than anything had before. On one hand, data science skills were in high demand by the private sector. On the other hand, Daniel wanted to continue his mission of overhauling science using tactics of openness. In the end, Daniel was faced with a tough decision between doing a postdoc in the Greene Lab at the University of Pennsylvania and being a bioinformatics specialist at Human Longevity, Inc. Offer deadlines led to a decision atop the Grand Bé tidal island in Saint-Malo, France. In a straight-to-YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/goIOtEpE8Lc" title="Deciding the next step after my PhD"&gt;recording&lt;/a&gt;, Daniel unveiled his decision via the displayed letter and formalized it by signing the official&amp;nbsp;documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="11-the-doctoral-mustache"&gt;11. The Doctoral&amp;nbsp;Mustache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Exhibit 11" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/phd-exhibit/exhibit-11.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the later half of 2015, Daniel realized he needed to get more serious if he wanted to graduate in a reasonable time. While he was already working hard, curiosity would lead him to inessential pursuits. He knew that all focus must be turned to completing Project Rephetio, the final act of his dissertation. So he adopted an incentives-based approach. Starting in late October 2015, he begun growth of a mustache not to be removed until graduation. To up the ante, he ceased drinking on January 11, 2016. These policies were widely detested by those close to Daniel. With official graduation just around the corner, Daniel relented following his thesis seminar on April 26, 2016. To thank Sergio for his mentorship and support, Daniel gave Sergio the satisfaction of removing his Doctoral Mustache, whose trimmings make up this final&amp;nbsp;exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"/><category term="exhibit"/><category term="PhD"/><category term="UCSF"/><category term="thesis"/></entry><entry><title>Four years of fellowship: annual summaries for my NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</title><link href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/nsf-year-summaries/" rel="alternate"/><published>2016-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-03-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Himmelstein</name></author><id>tag:blog.dhimmel.com,2016-03-06:/nsf-year-summaries/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a first year graduate student at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt;, I took a mandatory course titled &lt;a href="http://coursecatalog.ucsf.edu/course/142" title="Biophysics 297 · UCSF Registrar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Writing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which helped students apply for the National Science Foundation&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org" title="NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program Homepage"&gt;Graduate Research Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;At the end of each fellowship year, fellows submit an Annual Activities Report, which includes a written Fellowship Year Summary. Below I&amp;#8217;ve reproduced my summaries from the last four years. But first, here&amp;#8217;s a screenshot of the&amp;nbsp;prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Fellowship Year Summary prompt" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/nsf-year-summaries/prompt.png" title="Prompt for the Fellowship Year Summary"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-201213-dated-april-1-2013"&gt;Summary of 2012–13 dated April 1,&amp;nbsp;2013&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012–2013 reporting period spans my first and second years of graduate school. The first year of graduate school consisted of coursework, seminars, and rotations. My first rotation, supervised by Dr. Ryan Hernandez, focused on human evolution and population genomics. I simulated sequencing data capturing the complexity of human demographic history. During my second rotation with Dr. John Witte, I compared the prevalence of gene-gene associations with disease under additive and epistatic disease models. The project, related to my original &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; proposal, resulted in a poster presentation at the &lt;em&gt;American Society of Human Genetics Annual Meeting&lt;/em&gt;. In my third rotation, with Dr. Sergio Baranzini, I worked on modelling biological entities using heterogeneous networks. The project consisted of parsing and integrating publicly available databases. Professor Baranzini is now my advisor. My project aims to discover new uses for existing drugs using a network-based computational link prediction&amp;nbsp;technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my Personal Statement, I think science could be improved by better communication. Communication includes a broad range of issues ranging from writing style to open-access publishing. Over the past year, I’ve stressed my own ability to communicate. Professor Hernandez requested me as the teaching assistant for a new course he was teaching called &lt;em&gt;Computational Evolutionary Genomics&lt;/em&gt;. As part of the quarter long course, I led weekly discussion sections. I’ve also honed my communication skills through presentations to lab members, students, and&amp;nbsp;faculty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, I’ve begun to apply my interest in high-throughput computationally intensive problems to medicine. Through my research on drug repurposing, I not only hope to find new disease therapies, but also spread my scientific methodologies through improved scientific&amp;nbsp;communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-201314-dated-march-31-2014"&gt;Summary of 2013–14 dated March 31,&amp;nbsp;2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;/strong&gt;: Over the past year, my research has matured extensively. My project aims to identify genes associated with complex human diseases. My findings will help with disease susceptibility prediction and understanding what biological characteristics underlie pathogenic variants. The cross-disciplinary method improves on a technique first developed for social network analysis and relies on advanced machine learning and distributed computing. I applied for and received a $2,000 &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; Graduate Student Research Fellowship&lt;/em&gt; to add &lt;span class="caps"&gt;192GB&lt;/span&gt; of low-latency memory to our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HPC&lt;/span&gt; workstation. In the past year, I exhibited the work at the &lt;em&gt;American Society of Human Genetics Annual Meeting&lt;/em&gt; and presented it at the &lt;em&gt;Biomedical Computation at Stanford Symposium&lt;/em&gt;. I also discuss the project in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GPAvruPpZ3A" title="YouTube · ISMB 2014 Late Breaking Research Proposal"&gt;public youtube video&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;nbsp;created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;: My vision for science is one of greater accessibility and communication. I helped other students achieve proficiency in written communication as a teaching assistant for our program&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Writing Predoctoral Fellowships&lt;/em&gt; course. Personally, I assisted with peer-reviewing a journal manuscript and writing a grant proposal. In October, I traveled to Guatemala to participate in a &lt;em&gt;Forum on Innovation in Medical Education&lt;/em&gt;. Hosted by a private, forward-thinking University, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt;, the forum focused on designing a new medical degree program based on embracing disruptions. Throughout the forum I suggested ways for strong communication and accessibility to be embedded into the structure of the new curriculum. I am an outspoken advocate of open access publishing allowing unlimited reuse with attribution. I also support developments to make science more transparent and incremental. To that end, I have developed a &lt;a href="http://dhimmel.com/" title="Homepage of Daniel Himmelstein"&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt; describing my research and have begun posting material to &lt;a href="https://figshare.com/authors/Daniel_Himmelstein/523637" title="Daniel Himmelstein on figshare"&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-201415-dated-march-18-2015"&gt;Summary of 2014–15 dated March 18,&amp;nbsp;2015&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;/strong&gt;: My research focuses on making novel biological predictions from heterogeneous networks. Heterogeneous networks contain multiple entity and relationship types making them an ideal approach for data integration. Applying our edge prediction algorithm to a multiscale network of pathogenesis, we successfully predicted disease-associated genes, uncovered multiple sclerosis risk genes, and highlighted the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. This study is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/011569" title="bioRxiv · Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes"&gt;currently available&lt;/a&gt; as a preprint. In July, I gave my first talk at a major international conference, when I presented this research at the &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology&lt;/em&gt; conference in Boston, supported by an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt;-funded travel fellowship. Furthermore, our study was &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160330020546/http://biomedicalcomputationreview.org/content/unlocking-genetics-complex-diseases-gwas-and-beyond" title="Unlocking the Genetics of Complex Diseases: GWAS and Beyond"&gt;featured&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Biomedical Computation Review&lt;/em&gt;, a quarterly magazine produced by&amp;nbsp;Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we plan to identify new uses for existing drugs using our network-based approach. We hope to bring new life to the sluggish and increasingly expensive drug discovery process. Interested parties can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4" title="Repurposing drugs on a heterogeneous network"&gt;follow and contribute&lt;/a&gt; to this project in&amp;nbsp;real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;: In the last year, I have taken many steps to move science closer to my vision of openness. Realizing that science moves faster and reproducibility improves when source code is open, I made 156 public &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel" title="Daniel Himmelstein on GitHub"&gt;contributions on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, I created a website (&lt;a href="http://het.io/" title="Heterogeneous networks in bioinformatics"&gt;het.io&lt;/a&gt;) covering our research on heterogeneous networks. We provide our predictions of disease-associated genes through an interactive &lt;a href="http://het.io/disease-genes/browse/" title="hetio · Disease-Associated Gene Browser"&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt;. I also started a &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/" title="Satoshi Village · the blog of Daniel Himmelstein"&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; that aims to communicate science to a broad readership. Similarly, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; hosted a &lt;em&gt;three minute thesis&lt;/em&gt; competition, where students present their dissertation research with a general audience in mind. Although my submission was not selected as a finalist, I posted the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/oV3Wx14E7WE" title="YouTube · 2014 Three Minute Thesis Entry at UCSF"&gt;recording online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; also hosts a seminar series that accepts student speaker nominations. My nomination of Lior Pachter — professor at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt; Berkeley and author of the &lt;a href="https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/" title="Bits of DNA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bits of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; blog — was accepted and I was fortunate to arrange his visit and discuss science with him. Finally, I performed my first &lt;a href="https://publons.com/review/65947/" title="Publons review of 'Optimal Algorithm for Metabolomics Classification and Feature Selection varies by Dataset'"&gt;solo peer review&lt;/a&gt; for the open access journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/blog/post/97879213303/save-the-date-participative-bay-area-oa-week-event-for-generation-open/" title="PeerJ blog · Bay Area OA week event for Generation Open"&gt;Bay Area open access event&lt;/a&gt;, I met the founder of &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io/" title="Thinklab · a community for real-time open collaborative science"&gt;Thinklab&lt;/a&gt;, a nascent platform for massively collaborative open science. Our project on drug repurposing is one of the initial projects using the platform. Thinklab has funded our proposal and rewards community participants for contributing to the project. We have high hopes that the &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io/blog/introducing-thinklab-a-platform-for-massively-collaborative-open-science/38/" title="Introducing ThinkLab — A platform for massively collaborative open science"&gt;Thinklab model&lt;/a&gt; can accelerate science, help reproducibility, and encourage transparent&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary-of-201516-dated-march-6-2016"&gt;Summary of 2015–16 dated March 6,&amp;nbsp;2016&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;/strong&gt;: For the last year, I&amp;#8217;ve been constructing a network for drug repurposing. We will use the network to predict the probability that a given drug–disease pair is an efficacious treatment. Since the network contains multiple node and relationships types, it&amp;#8217;s called a hetnet — a term we&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d104" title="Thinklab discussion · Renaming ‘heterogeneous networks’ to a more concise and catchy term"&gt;formally popularizing&lt;/a&gt;. Our hope is that by integrating diverse data types, the hetnet will form a foundation for powerful&amp;nbsp;analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d112" title="Thinklab discussion · Using the neo4j graph database for hetnets"&gt;migrated&lt;/a&gt; to using the Neo4j graph database to store and operate on our hetnets. Leveraging this mature open source technology has improved our interoperability and provided new capabilities. Our &lt;a href="http://portal.graphgist.org/graph_gists/drug-repurposing-by-hetnet-relationship-prediction-a-new-hope" title="Neo4j GraphGist · Drug repurposing by hetnet relationship prediction: a new hope"&gt;interactive tutorial&lt;/a&gt; showcases our project and use of the Neo4j&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build our hetnet, we created several intermediate resources. We&amp;#8217;re particularly excited about three resources that we think the community will appreciate. First, we created a catalog of medical indications, which can be used to train and evaluate computational methods. The catalog was created by integrating four existing resources. However, we &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d95" title="Thinklab discussion · Expert curation of our indication catalog for disease-modifying treatments"&gt;recruited&lt;/a&gt; three physicians to review each drug–disease pair and classify it as disease-modifying or symptomatic. Second, we computed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d43#6" title="Thinklab discussion · Computing consensus transcriptional profiles for LINCS L1000 perturbations"&gt;consensus signatures&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LINCS&lt;/span&gt; L1000, which profiles transcriptional responses to perturbation. Third, we created a &lt;a href="https://git.dhimmel.com/gene-ontology/" title="User-friendly and customizable Gene Ontology annotations"&gt;user-friendly webapp&lt;/a&gt; for retrieving Gene Ontology&amp;nbsp;annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;: To construct our hetnet, we integrated 28 public resources. Even though the resources were publicly funded, copyright and access agreements created a major licensing headache. After a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d107" title="Thinklab discussion · Integrating resources with disparate licensing into an open network"&gt;7,500+ word discussion&lt;/a&gt; involving lawyers and other experts, we settled on the least bad way&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since undergoing this copyꞃightmare and realizing that a crisis looms, I&amp;#8217;ve become an advocate for data copyright and licensing reform in science. I presented on the legal problems related to data reuse at &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2Y2OIutYE4Y" title="YouTube · Copyright vs open science - Project Presentation at OpenCon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenCon&lt;/em&gt; in Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and at a local &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Jy-E7PheIRs" title="YouTube · Realtime Open Science on Thinklab &amp;amp; The Horrors of Data Copyright"&gt;Open Access Week event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been performing realtime, open notebook science using Thinklab and GitHub. Our drug repurposing &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4" title="Thinklab Project · Repurposing drugs on a hetnet"&gt;project on Thinklab&lt;/a&gt; has generated 60 discussions containing 346 comments by 8 project team members and 29 community reviewers. Getting feedback in the early stages has strengthened our project while helping us avoid poor uses of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I reviewed for &lt;a href="https://publons.com/review/245916/" title="Publons review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://publons.com/review/173426/" title="Publons review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; authored 906 public &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel" title="Daniel Himmelstein on GitHub"&gt;GitHub contributions&lt;/a&gt;; mentored an apprentice and an intern; and crafted a &lt;a href="https://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook" title="Slides · The Data Biologist Cookbook"&gt;data biologist cookbook&lt;/a&gt; for the new&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, while waiting for my accepted &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259" title="Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; to be published, I grew frustrated by the delays. I compared the delays at several journals in my field and &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/plos-and-publishing-delays/" title="Publication delays at PLOS and 3,475 other journals"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; the findings. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/523131f" title="Long wait for publication plagues many journals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://thepublicationplan.com/2015/07/02/publication-and-acceptance-times-for-over-3000-journals/" title="Publication and acceptance times for over 3,000 journals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Publication Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; covered my findings. Later I performed a more &lt;a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/history-of-delays/" title="The history of publishing delays"&gt;comprehensive analysis&lt;/a&gt; on the history of publishing delays, which was also covered by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/530148a" title="The Waiting Game · Does it take too long to publish research?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://thepublicationplan.com/2016/02/19/are-publishing-delays-getting-worse/" title="Are publishing delays getting worse?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Publication Plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. My goal with this research is to help researchers avoid excessive delays while replacing anecdote with evidence in the contemporary discussion of scientific&amp;nbsp;publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reflections"&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll close with four&amp;nbsp;reflections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My productivity exceeded linear growth over the four year period. Experience has played a role, in addition to the rise of open source tools for data&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of hyperlinks per year has grown rapidly from 0 to 3 to 13 to 21. I attribute much of this increase to open science, which has led to more public output per unit of research&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deadline has always been May 1, yet each year I&amp;#8217;ve finished the summary further in advance than the year before. Am I becoming less&amp;nbsp;just-in-time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have yet to &amp;#8220;discover new uses for existing drugs&amp;#8221; despite aiming for this in 2013. Let&amp;#8217;s make 2016 the&amp;nbsp;year!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a major question remained. Are publication delays getting shorter or longer? Kendall Powell, writing a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/530148a" title="The Waiting Game"&gt;feature for &lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released in tandem with this post, contacted me. Her investigation had uncovered a widespread belief that delays were worsening with time. But she wanted data, and the existing data was &lt;a href="http://wp.me/p4Ir7n-5Y" title="Waiting to Happen: Publication lag times in Cell Biology Journals"&gt;field specific&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.12-0901ufm" title="The Glacial Pace of Scientific Publishing"&gt;anecdotal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set out to uncover the history of publishing delays. Using PubMed, I&amp;nbsp;extracted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;acceptance delays&lt;/strong&gt;—days from receival to acceptance—for 3,330,333 articles since&amp;nbsp;1965&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;publishing delays&lt;/strong&gt;—days from acceptance to online publication—for 2,765,750 articles since&amp;nbsp;1997&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;through the end of 2015. PubMed relies on publishers to deposit history dates. Frequently, publishers opt not to provide histories, and occasionally they provide erroneous dates. As a result, publishing delays for many journals will be missing or&amp;nbsp;incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="acceptance-delays"&gt;Acceptance&amp;nbsp;delays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time between submission and acceptance encapsulates editorial decision, peer review, and revision. Below, we visualize 35 years of acceptance delays. Each year, the green lines indicate delay percentiles, spaced every 2.5 points with quartiles bolded. The gray band displays a curve fitted for all articles over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Acceptance delay versus year accepted" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/delays/59310065e325c71e7d121be240a0a3bc60875cc4/viz/acceptance-by-article.png" title="35 years of acceptance delays"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of journals reporting acceptance delays prior to 1981 &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/delays/blob/59310065e325c71e7d121be240a0a3bc60875cc4/data/yearly-summaries.tsv" title="Table with yearly publishing delay summaries"&gt;is in&lt;/a&gt; the single digits, so drawing conclusions on those early years would be premature. However since 1981, the median acceptance delay has teetered around the 100 day mark. So on a per article level, acceptance delays don&amp;#8217;t appear to be worsening. If anything, long delays are becoming less frequent as evidenced by the downward sloping third quartile line and best-fit curve since&amp;nbsp;1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested in a specific journal? Use the box below to select from 3,086 journals with acceptance delay histories. Red dots represent individual&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;select id="select-accept" style="width:100%"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;img id="delay-img-accept" title="Acceptance delay history" style="width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="publication-delays"&gt;Publication&amp;nbsp;delays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online publication &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3998/3336451.0003.212" title="Electronic Journals and Scholarly Communication"&gt;began in the ’90s&lt;/a&gt; and quickly became standard. Nowadays, since print rarely precedes online access, an article&amp;#8217;s online debut is its effective date of publication. Conveniently in PubMed, precise dates are considerably more available for online compared to print&amp;nbsp;publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time between acceptance and online publication encapsulates typesetting, proofing, and occasionally press releasing. The plot below shows the history of online publication delays since 2000, the first year with a double-digit number of&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Publication delay versus year published" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/delays/59310065e325c71e7d121be240a0a3bc60875cc4/viz/publication-by-article.png" title="16 years of online publication delays"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publication delays have approximately been cut in half since the early 2000s. Progress hit a plateau in 2009 with the median delay stabilizing around 25 days. However, the longest delays steadily decreased up until&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings illustrate the transformative power of the digital age: publication speed doubled and now greater transparency will bring scrutiny to the stragglers, who will hopefully pick up their pace. Below, select from 2,756 journals with publication delay&amp;nbsp;histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;select id="select-publish" style="width:100%"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;
&lt;img id="delay-img-publish" title="Online publishing delay history" style="width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="journal-trends"&gt;Journal&amp;nbsp;trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last decade witnessed the rise of the megajournal. By &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.981" title="Björk (2015) PeerJ"&gt;rapidly publishing a large quantity&lt;/a&gt; of articles, megajournals could be driving article-level delay trends. So what about journal-level delay trends? If you select a random journal, are you more likely to see increasing or decreasing&amp;nbsp;delays?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each journal, I regressed article delay versus date. The resulting slope indicates the average number of days a journal&amp;#8217;s delays increased per year. The distributions of these slopes are shown below. Dashes indicate quartiles and crosses indicate&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Journal-level delay trends" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/delays/59310065e325c71e7d121be240a0a3bc60875cc4/viz/slope-distributions.png" title="Violin plots of change in delay distributions"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;69% percent of journals experienced decreasing publication delays. However in terms of acceptance delays, journals were roughly split between quickening and slowing. These findings suggest that the article-level trends above are generally occurring amongst journals, rather than being dominated by a few&amp;nbsp;megajournals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briefly, here are some limitations the reader should be aware&amp;nbsp;of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PubMed contains erroneous dates. However, we apply quality controls such as removing negative delays and zero-day&amp;nbsp;acceptances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depositing dates in PubMed is optional leading to the potential for selection&amp;nbsp;bias.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1511912112" title="Accelerating scientific publication in biology"&gt;overall time till publication&lt;/a&gt; is outside the scope of this analysis. Growing manuscripts, rejection rates, and author lists could make the overall publication process more laborious even if individual journals are becoming&amp;nbsp;quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no standard for&amp;nbsp;PubMed&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;receival&lt;/code&gt; date. Some journals use the date of initial submission while others use resubmission or revised-submission&amp;nbsp;dates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://svpow.com/2012/10/03/dear-royal-society-please-stop-lying-to-us-about-publication-times/" title="Dear Royal Society, please stop lying to us about publication times"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that journals favor decisions of &amp;#8220;reject and resubmit&amp;#8221; rather than &amp;#8220;revise&amp;#8221; to shorten their reported acceptance delays. &lt;a href="http://smallpondscience.com/2015/05/20/what-ever-happened-to-major-and-minor-revisions/" title="What ever happened to major and minor revisions?"&gt;Some feel&lt;/a&gt; this practice is increasing with&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisional publication—whereby publishers release a pre-typeset article (generally as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; only) prior to complete online publication—blurs the meaning of&amp;nbsp;publication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeaway here is that, as a whole, PubMed acceptance delays likely underestimate the actual time it takes to get a manuscript accepted. I encourage readers to explore and build on this analysis, which is &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/delays/tree/history-blog-post" title="GitHub Repository: dhimmel/delays at history-blog-post"&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and citeable via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOI&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.45516" title="Zenodo deposition of the GitHub repository for this analysis"&gt;10.5281/zenodo.45516&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing delays haven&amp;#8217;t ballooned. However, there&amp;#8217;s plenty of room for improvement. I&amp;#8217;d like to see existing journals strive towards acceptance within two months and publication within two weeks. In the meantime, scientists looking to circumvent delays should consider &lt;a href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/preprints-2015/" title="The preprint in 2015 and what comes next"&gt;preprinting&lt;/a&gt; or realtime platforms such as &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io/" title="A community for realtime open collaborative science"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Prior to 2015, &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/dhimmel/81f55d62af27197a845e" title="Growth of bioscience preprints in 2015"&gt;on average&lt;/a&gt; 1.2 preprints per day compared to 2.4 for &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;. Yet in 2015, &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; averaged 2.3 per day while &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; averaged 4.9. Since together &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; published only 2,626 preprints in 2015 while PubMed grew by 1,082,213 articles, the ~100% annual growth in preprinting could persist for the next several&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/blog/post/115284878288/a-peerj-preprint-so-just-what-is-that-exactly/" title="A PeerJ PrePrint – so just what is that exactly?"&gt;incentives&lt;/a&gt; for preprinting will likely spur continued growth. In short, the benefits—establishing precedent and increased article lifespan—outweigh the disadvantages—ineligibility to a &lt;a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/browse.php?colour=white&amp;amp;la=en&amp;amp;fIDnum=|&amp;amp;mode=simple" title="SHERPA/RoMEO List of white publishers"&gt;dwindling set&lt;/a&gt; of démodé journals. While preprint servers may not provide the same visibility as journal, they can still be influential. For example, my first preprint &lt;a href="http://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook#/2/2" title="Data Biologist Cookbook: Unlocking the Genetics of Complex Diseases"&gt;was featured&lt;/a&gt; in a review, and my second &lt;a href="http://slides.com/dhimmel/data-biologist-cookbook#/2/1" title="Data Biologist Cookbook: Oxygen driven tumorigenesis"&gt;drove interest&lt;/a&gt; in the&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final drawback is the &lt;a href="https://clauswilke.com/blog/2014/11/01/the-google-scholar-preprint-bug/" title="The Google Scholar preprint bug"&gt;Google Scholar bug&lt;/a&gt;, where the existence of a preprint prevents subsequent journal publication from appearing in the Google Scholar database. Despite &lt;a href="https://clauswilke.com/blog/2014/12/02/how-google-scholar-discourages-young-scientists-from-posting-preprints/" title="How Google Scholar discourages young scientists from posting preprints"&gt;discouraging&lt;/a&gt; openness and &lt;a href="https://clauswilke.com/blog/2015/10/08/google-scholar-bug-redux/" title="The Google Scholar preprint bug redux"&gt;frequently occurring&lt;/a&gt;, the bug is &lt;a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/05/guest-post-highwires-john-sack-on-online-indexing-of-scholarly-publications-part-1-what-we-all-have-accomplished/#comment-60508" title="Post by Anurag Acharya on the Scholarly Kitchen"&gt;considered a &amp;#8220;feature&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by Scholar&amp;#8217;s creator, so don&amp;#8217;t expect a resolution anytime&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cruel twist is the longer the publishing delay, the &lt;a href="https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2015/10/05/guest-post-highwires-john-sack-on-online-indexing-of-scholarly-publications-part-1-what-we-all-have-accomplished/#comment-60515" title="Post by Anurag Acharya on the Scholarly Kitchen"&gt;greater the chance&lt;/a&gt; of triggering the Scholar preprint bug. For example, my first study on hetnets experienced a delay of 105 days from acceptance to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259" title="Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes"&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt; on July 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. Now, 179 days later, Google Scholar still only indexes the &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; preprint. Double&amp;nbsp;whammy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While preprints are a workaround for excessive publication delays, their current incarnations are limited. There has been little preprint innovation since &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/677899029976473600" title="Tweet: Little innovation in preprint servers since 1997"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; preprints are still &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; only, with no web display, although &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; appears to be aware of this problem given their creation of &lt;a href="https://github.com/PeerJ/paper-now" title="Create, edit and display a journal article, entirely in GitHub"&gt;paper-now&lt;/a&gt;, a GitHub Pages solution to&amp;nbsp;publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints bring us closer to open science, which has been &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LwW1-X3glak" title="Open research video"&gt;defined as&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scientists sharing their research with the world as soon as they record it for&amp;nbsp;themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preprints help counteract publishing delays, which are by definition anti-open. However, preprints are not a panacea! Withholding publication until a study is complete is a major obstacle towards greater scientific&amp;nbsp;efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is most helpful early on, when mistakes are still rectifiable. And scientific outputs are often must useful when young, while still state of the art. Platforms such as &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io" title="A community for real-time open collaborative science"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://riojournal.com/" title="Research Ideas and Outcomes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com" title="GitHub"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; now allow collaborative open science from a project&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, I&amp;#8217;m performing my &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.4" title="Repurposing drugs on a heterogeneous network"&gt;current project&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt;. In the last year, 22 community &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io/p/rephetio/leaderboard/" title="Project leaderboard on Thinklab"&gt;participants&lt;/a&gt; contributed feedback across 57 &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io/p/rephetio/discussion/" title="Project discussions on Thinklab"&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;ve created lots of valuable content that&amp;#8217;s been accruing views, citations, and page rank—none of which would exist had we withheld sharing until completing a&amp;nbsp;preprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I wholeheartedly recommend preprinting, I encourage those interested in major scientific disruption to look&amp;nbsp;further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, here are three recommendations for maximizing the potential of your science with&amp;nbsp;preprints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release your preprint under a &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" title="Creative Commons — Attribution 4.0 International"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; license to encourage reuse and hence&amp;nbsp;citation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat your preprint as a publication: all data and code needed to reproduce the study should be available and appropriately&amp;nbsp;licensed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to update your preprint with revisions. Help readers stay up to date while gaining visibility on the recents&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/li&gt;

A hefty nuclear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; could destroy unprotected electronic equipment within a thousand miles radius. The podcast motivated me recount my strange story involving EMPs and slime&amp;nbsp;molds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="arguing-the-unforeseen"&gt;Arguing the&amp;nbsp;unforeseen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year was 2010. I was a junior at Cornell, where I was on the debate team. In policy debate, there is a single topic for the entire year. And this year the topic was nuclear weapons. The season was in full swing. My partner and I were preparing for the National Debate Tournament&amp;nbsp;qualifiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had qualified our sophomore year, but only by the skin of our teeth. We needed a single ballot in the final round of the qualifiers, but were paired against a seemingly invincible opponent from Harvard. After the debate, expecting defeat, we nervously waited for the last judge to cast his ballot. Minutes turned to hours. Finally, the judge marked his vote, folded the ballot, and handed it to an elderset guru of the activity to&amp;nbsp;announce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did it! I jumped up to embrace my partner and accidentally kneed him in the&amp;nbsp;balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to repeat the suspense, we were preparing vigorously for this year&amp;#8217;s qualifier. To catch the opponents off guard, we had to prepare a novel proposal — one that had not been debated by any of the thousands of teams nationwide that&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon the topic of nuclear EMPs. Information was scant. Whether the major superpowers even considered high altitude detonation in their nuclear planning was poorly documented. My sources were fringe. I even had to order a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0964764369" title="High-Altitude Nuclear War by John Lewallen"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; because no university libraries carried it. Nevertheless, we pieced together a proposal to ban high altitude nuclear explosions to reduce the likelihood of debilitating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing your own arguments is not essential for debate. But picking winning arguments is. Policy debate assumes an environment of natural selection: throughout a season, the arguments that survive are likely the most&amp;nbsp;veracious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, in the midst of sensationalism designed to outweigh the opponent&amp;#8217;s criticism, I sensed a certain truth to our argument. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; threat is real and our society is ill-prepared. Ironically, we lost the one and only debate where we deployed this&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, finally posting the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1487717" title="Cornell HKs EMP affirmative from the 2009-2010 collegiate policy debate season"&gt;130 page compilation&lt;/a&gt; of evidence we compiled for a single loss will provide some&amp;nbsp;closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="meanwhile-in-the-land-of-slime"&gt;Meanwhile in the land of&amp;nbsp;slime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same semester, I came across a study on slime mold, presumably via &lt;a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/10/01/22/1715229/slime-mold-could-lead-to-better-tech" title="Slime Mold Could Lead To Better Tech"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; because I didn&amp;#8217;t have Twitter yet. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1177894" title="Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; used a slime mold species, &lt;em&gt;Physarum polycephalum&lt;/em&gt;, to create a blueprint of Tokyo&amp;#8217;s railway&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slime mold was unlike any life form I had seen. In its vegetative state, called a plasmodium, the slime mold forms a gigantic single cell containing many nuclei. It moves by pulsating, generally in search of its preferred food source, &lt;a href="http://www.quakeroats.com/" title="Quaker Oats Homepage"&gt;Quaker Oats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="videoWrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe width="604" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lls27hu03yw?start=10&amp;feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;theme=light&amp;showinfo=0&amp;autohide=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reconstruct the Tokyo railway, researchers placed Quaker Oats in a petri dish corresponding to population centers. Since slime mold detests light, the researchers illuminated areas corresponding to geographic no-nos such as lakes and mountains. Originating downtown, the slime mold initially expanded throughout the petri dish. Then the slime mold retracted to form a tubular network connecting the food sources. When analyzed for efficiency, cost, and fault tolerance, these networks were often comparable or superior to the real&amp;nbsp;deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-slime-and-emp-converge"&gt;The slime and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;converge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, my junior spring, I took the best course of my Cornell experience, &lt;a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info2040_2010sp/" title="Computer Science 2850, Cornell University, Spring 2010"&gt;networks&lt;/a&gt;. The final paper asked for an &amp;#8220;exploration of a topic related to the course.&amp;#8221; I &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1488841" title="Biologically inspired designs for restoring power transmission after an electromagnetic pulse attack"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; using slime mold networks to reconstruct the power grid after an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; attack. Food sources would represent power plants. Slime mold would be tasked with reconnecting the power grid, but constrained by a light gradient representing the&amp;nbsp;blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://wl.figshare.com/articles/1488841/embed?show_title=0" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMP&lt;/span&gt; had a short lived debate appearance, it did help me get an &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; in&amp;nbsp;class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-slime-still-slithers"&gt;The slime still&amp;nbsp;slithers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second year of my PhD at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt;, I was required to present at a journal club. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215037109" title="Slime mold uses an externalized spatial memory to navigate in complex environments"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using the same species of slime mold as before caught my interest. The study found that the plasmodium deposits a slime trail, which it exploits for spacial memory. In other words, when foraging for Quaker Oats, the slime mold preferentially explores untrotted areas. The &lt;a href="https://www.slideshare.net/himmelstein/slime-mold-short" title="Intelligent slime mold, but can it remember?"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt; from my presentation are&amp;nbsp;below:&lt;/p&gt;

Frustrated, I decided to investigate whether such delays are commonplace at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="publication-and-acceptance-delays-at-plos"&gt;Publication and acceptance delays at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by retrieving all PubMed records for the 7 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals. For each journal, I randomly selected 1000 articles and scraped the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; website for receival, acceptance, and publication timestamps. Using this scraped data, I plotted publishing delays over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PLOS publication times from website scraping" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/scraped-plos-publication-times.png" title="Scraped PLOS publication times"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not alone! Starting in 2011, publications delays at &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; began regularly breaching 80 days. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pathogens&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Neglected Tropical Diseases&lt;/em&gt; experienced similar publishing delay explosions in 2011, although appear to have recently improved. These extreme temporal fluctuations suggest that delays are not an innate and immutable characteristic of publishing, but instead dependent on operational efficiency and organizational&amp;nbsp;well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two oldest and most established &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals, &lt;em&gt;Biology&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, followed a different pattern: long delays in their early years followed by stability at 40 days since 2009. The dearth of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Biology&lt;/em&gt; records prior to 2009, resulted from broken &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOI&lt;/span&gt; redirects. Before my scraper finished its duties, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/613842560360951808" title="Twitter · PLOS Biology DOI resolution error"&gt;fixed the issue&lt;/a&gt; resulting in the few visible &lt;em&gt;Biology&lt;/em&gt; articles of that&amp;nbsp;period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scraped data is nice because it comes directly from the source, but is time intensive and limited to a single webpage layout. Therefore, I also extracted timestamps from PubMed. Below I show publication (solid lines) and acceptance (dotted lines) times from this larger&amp;nbsp;dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PLOS acceptance and publication times from PubMed" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/plos-stages.png" title="PLOS acceptance times (dotted line) and publication times (solid line)"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more articles, fine-grained temporal trends emerge. The findings are consistent with the scraped data. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; appears to have made some recent improvement, but still is over 50 days from acceptance to&amp;nbsp;publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding acceptance time, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Medicine&lt;/em&gt; is an outlier, teetering around the 200 day mark. This finding is in line with my single experience with &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, which consisted of poor communication and&amp;nbsp;delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt; has historically fared well compared to other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals both in acceptance and publication times. However, delays at &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt; have been relentlessly trending upwards. The focus on technical validity rather than article impact at &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; One&lt;/em&gt; likely contributes to quicker review and revision&amp;nbsp;periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="publication-and-acceptance-delays-for-plos-alternatives"&gt;Publication and acceptance delays for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I decided to compile recent delay information for as many journals as possible. I instructed my PubMed querier to retrieve records for all 1,572,538 publications since 2014. Of these articles, 667,773 had timestamps. PubMed data is not perfect. For example, 9,945 articles had anachronistic timestamps and were&amp;nbsp;omitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at delays for open access journals in my field. Below, publication time distributions are shown for 16&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Publishing time per journal" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/publication-days-violinplot.png" title="Publication delays for 16 open access journals in my field"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; has the highest median publication time. Since all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; journals use the same editorial and typesetting system, the poor performance across the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; family is&amp;nbsp;unsurprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; is quickest with a majority of articles published within 3 days after acceptance. The comparison is skewed because &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; allows &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627174355/http://elifesciences.org/content/early/recent"&gt;early access&lt;/a&gt; to a pre-formatted article &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;. However, early access provides many of the benefits of publication such as visibility and&amp;nbsp;citability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I looked at acceptance times for the same 16&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Acceptance time per journal" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhimmel/plostime/39ff289cae08c81bce6aed499e8df391a05b2107/figure/acceptance-days-violinplot.png" title="Acceptance delays for 16 open access journals in my field"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PeerJ&lt;/em&gt; is a clear winner with a median time of 74 days. The variation between journals for acceptance time is less drastic than for publication time: peer review sets a lower limit on the time needed for&amp;nbsp;acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="publication-and-acceptance-times-for-all-journals"&gt;Publication and acceptance times for all&amp;nbsp;journals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the median days till acceptance and publication for 3,482 journals. A journal may be omitted if it is not indexed by PubMed or had no timestamped articles since&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table id="journals" class="display" cellspacing="0" width="100%"&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id="calling-for-a-journal-review-service"&gt;Calling for a journal review&amp;nbsp;service&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceptance and publication times are not the only factor to consider when selecting a journal. Traditionally, the impact factor &amp;#8212; average citations for articles published in the two preceding years &amp;#8212; has been a primary criteria. However, any single metric is insufficient to make an informed decision on where to submit. A host of other journal attributes matter such as readership, aesthetics, communication, friendliness, flexibility, features, and web&amp;nbsp;nativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose a journal review service. Like yelp for scientific publishing except that author reviews will be &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" title="Creative Commons — Attribution 4.0 International"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I see three main&amp;nbsp;benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency &amp;#8212; past author experiences with a journal are a treasure trove in need of a display&amp;nbsp;case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search &amp;#8212; even finding all journals that publish research in your field is difficult. A search feature would support filters and rankings based on user&amp;nbsp;preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progress &amp;#8212; journals can improve based on their feedback. If not, they will&amp;nbsp;perish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know in the comments if any services already exist to fulfill this&amp;nbsp;role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="in-conclusion"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal in performing this extensive evaluation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; publishing times was to bring light to an area of publishing that needed it. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; led the open access revolution and still has its unique advantages. Hopefully, public feedback will allow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLOS&lt;/span&gt; to improve in the areas where it&amp;nbsp;struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

I had not heard of &lt;a href="http://opendataday.org/" title="International Open Data Hackathon"&gt;Open Data Day&lt;/a&gt; until now but look forward to attending a local hackathon on its next&amp;nbsp;occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year began with a major leap. I embarked on a fully open research project. First, I posted our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.a5" title="Proposal: Repurposing drugs on a heterogeneous network"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Thinklab&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8212; a platform that pays scientists to interact openly. We constantly revise the proposal based on feedback. All research is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science" title="Open notebook science"&gt;open notebook&lt;/a&gt;. And we post our analyses upon their&amp;nbsp;conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process has been a thrilling success. Currently &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io/p/rephetio/leaderboard/" title="Thinklab leaderboard"&gt;16 contributors&lt;/a&gt; have provided feedback and assistance, earning an estimated $1,136 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; for their 59 comments. Our project has birthed &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io/p/rephetio/discussion/" title="Project discussions"&gt;32 discussions&lt;/a&gt;, each one a citable work with a dedicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOI&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve made 350 public github &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel" title="Daniel Himmelstein's GitHub"&gt;contributions&lt;/a&gt; this year and published 23 project-related &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel?tab=repositories" title="Daniel Himmelstein's GitHub repositories"&gt;repositories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take pleasure in sifting through data, extracting insights, and providing condensed user-friendly derivations. To this end, I have created several websites: a &lt;a href="http://het.io/disease-genes/browse/" title="hetio · Disease-associated gene browser"&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt; for my results, a &lt;a href="https://git.dhimmel.com/gene-ontology/" title="GO Annotations · User-friendly Gene Ontology Annotations"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; for sets of related genes, and an &lt;a href="http://git.dhimmel.com/SIDER2/" title="SIDER 2 Tutorial &amp;amp; Analysis"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of side effects extracted from drug&amp;nbsp;labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; marked the culmination of an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705" title="Lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation: evidence for oxygen as an inhaled carcinogen"&gt;independent study&lt;/a&gt; coauthored with &lt;a href="http://www.ksimeonov.com/" title="Kamen Simeonov Homepage"&gt;my roommate&lt;/a&gt;. Using only publicly-available data, we identified an association between lung cancer and elevation. The study &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/609054266645426176" title="PLOS article level metrics show increased interest in oxygen driven tumorigenesis"&gt;spurred interest&lt;/a&gt; in the topic and received lots of attention. It currently &lt;a href="https://www.altmetric.com/details/3060395#score" title="Altmetric summary: score in context"&gt;ranks&lt;/a&gt; in the 99.9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of articles tracked by Altmetric. &lt;em&gt;PeerJ&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#questions" title="Lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation: Questions"&gt;question feature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/cruk-reassessment/" title="The Cancer Research UK Reassessment of our Lung Cancer versus Elevation Study"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; served as post-publication venues for further investigation. The study cost no money and illustrates how open data facilitates citizen&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While personally motivated by ideology, I know the move to openness must be driven by incentives. I hope to illustrate the benefits by example, but am also a hardened and vocal advocate.

&lt;p&gt;I predict new uses for existing drugs by mining the union of many diverse datasets. My project integrates over &lt;a href="https://think-lab.github.io/p/rephetio/proposal/#metanodes" title="Table 1.

&lt;p&gt;Two consequences of open science attract me: hastening discovery and enabling anyone to be a&amp;nbsp;scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I yearn to see the reality behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave" title="Plato's Allegory of the Cave"&gt;shadows&lt;/a&gt;.

If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of dwarfs that &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt; dwarf the&amp;nbsp;giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-would-you-use-your-experience-at-opencon-to-advance-open-access-open-education-andor-open-data"&gt;How would you use your experience at OpenCon to advance Open Access, Open Education and/or Open&amp;nbsp;Data?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our weapons are immaterial &amp;#8212; crowdsourced knowledge, open source, the public domain, and technical standards &amp;#8212; yet nonetheless require a coordinated&amp;nbsp;sharpening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central authority is antithetical to open science. The open scientist limits herself only by the bounds of possibility and heeds no artificial constraint. How then, without a ruler, does a decentralized community coordinate? Can an army of isolated heretics wage war on a unified front? The soldiers must be brought&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenCon 2015&lt;/em&gt; is that gathering. With an assembly of 163, 13,203 peer-to-peer interactions are possible.

However, we find several aspects of their interpretation&amp;nbsp;troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we find it unwise to discount our study because it analyzed counties rather than individuals. As &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.54.5.326" title="The ecological fallacy strikes back"&gt;Professor Pearce explains&lt;/a&gt;, much of our current understanding of cancer risk arose initially from &lt;strong&gt;ecological studies&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the key area in which epidemiologists have been able to &amp;#8220;add value&amp;#8221; has been through this population focus, although this lesson has been forgotten by many modern epidemiologists. For example, many of the recent discoveries on the causes of cancer (including dietary factors and colon cancer, hepatitis B and liver cancer, aflatoxins and liver cancer, human papilloma virus and cervical cancer) have their origins, directly or indirectly, in the systematic international comparisons of cancer incidence conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. These suggested hypotheses concerning the possible causes of the international patterns, which were investigated in more depth in further studies. In some instances these hypotheses were consistent with biological knowledge at the time, but in other instances they were new and striking, and might not have been proposed, or investigated further, if the population level analyses had not been&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to these influential studies of the past, our study benefitted from smaller population units (counties, not states as Ms. Osgun asserts), greater data availability, greater adjustment for potential confounding factors, and modern statistical techniques. Nonetheless, we view our findings as a starting point for further epidemiological and experimental research. In the meantime, we view oxygen-driven tumorigenesis as the most plausible explanation based on established knowledge regarding the underlying&amp;nbsp;biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of oxygen as a carcinogen is neither radical nor novel, as evidenced by the 1978 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; letter titled, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/274606a0" title="Are physiological oxygen concentrations mutagenic?"&gt;Are physiological oxygen concentrations mutagenic?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; (Hint: &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; rarely publishes negative results). Our study alone &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-2"&gt;cites&lt;/a&gt; over a dozen studies supporting oxygen&amp;#8217;s direct role in carcinogenesis. The evidence spans the spectrum from molecular to cellular to organismal and to clinical. Inspired molecular oxygen results in intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species, which lead to mutations. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019785" title="Ambient Oxygen Promotes Tumorigenesis"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; found mice that were predisposed to cancer took twice as long to develop tumors when housed in low-oxygen chambers. Finally, oxygen toxicity in the human lung is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.88.6.900" title="Pulmonary oxygen toxicity"&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2005.03.008" title="Childhood Cancer Following Neonatal Oxygen Supplementation"&gt;childhood cancer increases following neonatal oxygen supplementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;strong&gt;biological plausibility&lt;/strong&gt;, the criticism identifies four other characteristics of strong epidemiological evidence. We believe our study satisfies these&amp;nbsp;criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting for other factors&lt;/strong&gt;: For lung cancer, we included &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705/table-1" title="Table 1: Predictor information and inclusion."&gt;11 factors&lt;/a&gt; in addition to elevation to adjust for important demographic and cancer-risk factors. These factors include established risk factors (such as smoking, radon, and pollution), lifestyle variables (such as obesity, education, income, and race), and demographics (such as percent male and whether the county is metropolitan). We didn&amp;#8217;t include an age variable because our cancer rates were already age-adjusted to the 2000-census population. Furthermore, the inverse association persisted when we performed the analysis separately within each of the ten states, for males and females, and for those over and under 65 years of age. Since the causal factor appeared to affect every county, every state, both sexes, and all ages, pervasive environmental variables were the most likely confounders. Thus, we evaluated seven environmental variables such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UVB&lt;/span&gt; exposure, temperature, and precipitation. All seven alternative variables produced models over one billion times less likely than the elevation-including&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large numbers&lt;/strong&gt;: The probability of our observed association between lung cancer and elevation occurring by chance is less than one in a quadrillion. After filtering counties to only those with high-quality data, 253 counties remained for lung cancer. In the year 2000, these 253 counties had a combined population of 59,659,978, hardly a small&amp;nbsp;number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbiased&lt;/strong&gt;: We minimized potential biases from a variety of angles. Counties with high migration rates and Native American composition &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705/supp-1" title="Quality Control Filters"&gt;were filtered&lt;/a&gt;. Counties with populations below 10,000 &amp;#8212; whose measurements had greater margins of error &amp;#8212; were excluded, and the remaining counties were weighted by population in the analysis. Finally, we carefully selected the Western United States to minimize extraneous variation, which could cause bias, while capturing the variation in elevation of this mountainous&amp;nbsp;region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;: By definition, every breakthrough finding in science has yet to be reproduced upon discovery. We encourage replication on different regions and with different study designs. Our entire dataset, analysis pipeline, results, and codebase are public to make this task easier for&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criticism mentions the &lt;strong&gt;lag time&lt;/strong&gt; between exposure to cigarette smoke and lung cancer as a potential confounder and considers the recency of our smoking data as the &amp;#8220;likely&amp;#8221; culprit behind elevation&amp;#8217;s association with lung cancer. Let us destruct this argument using data. To assess the change in smoking, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-7954-12-5" title="Cigarette smoking prevalence in US counties: 1996-2012"&gt;we collected county smoking prevalences for 1996 and 2012&lt;/a&gt;. For the counties included in our lung cancer analysis, county smoking prevalence in 1996 was tightly linked to smoking prevalence in 2012 (first panel below). In other words, county smoking prevalences are relatively stable over time and were older smoking data available to us, the effect on our findings would likely be minimal. Next, we found that elevation was only &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; correlated with change in smoking rates over the 16 year period (second panel). For the lag time issue to present a serious omitted-variable bias, elevation and change in smoking would have to be &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; correlated. Finally, we evaluated the correlation between change in smoking and each of the 17 variables included in our lung cancer models. We found that six variables are more correlated with change in smoking than elevation (third panel). In other words, even if the lag time issue were capable of creating a spurious association between elevation and lung cancer, any of six variables we accounted for would prevent this&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The lag time between smoking exposure and cancer is unlikely to confound the elevation association." src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/cruk-reassessment/smoking-lagtime.png" title="Smoking Analysis"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we would like to conclude by reiterating a few points from the paper. First, the elevation association was specific to lung cancer and did not extend to breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, providing evidence for an inhaled carcinogen. Second, the magnitude of the association was large, second only to smoking and responsible for a 12.7% decrease in lung cancer incidence for an 1000 meter rise. The likelihood of spurious associations, and especially ecological fallacy, decreases with effect size. Third, we performed extensive measures to avoid confounding, such as the &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-42"&gt;stratification&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-45"&gt;subgrouping&lt;/a&gt; analyses, which Ms. Osgun fails to address. Finally, our publication is open access with a public peer review history, and we released our entire &lt;a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/elevcan" title="Project GitHub Repository"&gt;code, analysis, and results&lt;/a&gt;. We took these measures to allow independent verification and evidence-based data-driven reanalysis rather than&amp;nbsp;speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="findings"&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated whether cancer rates varied with altitude. Our primary focus was lung cancer, since the lung comes into direct contact with inhaled air and the level of atmospheric oxygen decreases with elevation. The same reactivity of oxygen that makes it an ideal input for respiration also risks causing cellular damage and mutation. Therefore, we evaluated whether inhaled oxygen is a human carcinogen by investigating the association between cancer and elevation. We analyzed ~250 counties in the Western United States, where the mountainous terrain results in varying elevations and high quality county data is&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that lung cancer decreased dramatically with rising elevation. This trend did not extend to breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer supporting our hypothesis that the elevation-dependent carcinogen is inhaled. The association between lung cancer and elevation remained after accounting for potential confounding factors, such as smoking, pollution, and obesity. Additionally, other environmental variables that could protect against lung cancer, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UVB&lt;/span&gt; exposure (an indicator of sunlight-induced vitamin D synthesis), were unable to replace the effect of&amp;nbsp;elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convey the magnitude of the observed association, we imagine a hypothetical situation where the entire United States elevates to the level of the highest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; county (San Juan, Colorado at 3,473 meters / 11,395 feet). Were all other factors to remain constant, we estimate 65,496 fewer new cases of lung cancer would arise per year. For comparison, 224,210 new cases of lung cancer &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21208" title="Cancer statistics, 2014"&gt;arose&lt;/a&gt; in the United States last&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we don&amp;#8217;t recommend anyone relocate just yet and the risk for nonsmokers is low, experimental confirmation of oxygen-driven tumorgenesis could lead to new insights that yield better lung cancer preventions and treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Several interesting phenomena are revealed. The two largest clusters correspond to childhood and college, two highly social and prolonged eras of my life. My hometown friends formed two communities: those who graduated highschool in 2007 or before (purple) and those who graduated after 2007 (blue). My maternal kindred are tightly clustered forming their own community (dark green): my mom is one of sixteen siblings. My brother is the intermediate blue node between my hometown and kin clusters. I went to summer camp for nearly a decade in New Hampshire. These friends (light green community) are proximal but separate from my hometown friends. My 300-mile journey to a college full of new acquaintances manifests in a cluster distant from the rest of the network. At Cornell, I joined a fraternity as well as the debate team. However, only debate forms its own community reflecting the greater social isolation of that activity. Finally, my colleagues and classmates at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSF&lt;/span&gt; are tightly clustered. The distant offshoot from this cluster represents the individuals I met while participating in a &lt;a href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/imef-guatemala/" title="Innovation in Medical Education Forum"&gt;medical education forum in Guatemala&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage my readers to play around with their own friendship networks. One interesting aspect is discovering the friends which bridge one&amp;#8217;s various communities. Additionally, unconnected nodes most commonly indicate serendipitous encounters or sockpuppet accounts. I used the &lt;a href="https://apps.facebook.com/netvizz/" title="Facebook netvizz App"&gt;netvizz app&lt;/a&gt; to extract my friendship network from Facebook and &lt;a href="https://gephi.org/" title="Gephi Homepage"&gt;Gephi&lt;/a&gt; for&amp;nbsp;visualization.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"/><category term="networks"/><category term="modules"/><category term="facebook"/><category term="friendship"/><category term="social network analysis"/><category term="graphs"/><category term="netvizz"/></entry><entry><title>Innovation in Medical Education Forum</title><link href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/imef-guatemala/" rel="alternate"/><published>2013-11-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-11-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Daniel Himmelstein</name></author><id>tag:blog.dhimmel.com,2013-11-19:/imef-guatemala/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;During the first week of October in 2013, I traveled to Guatemala.

The forum produced suggestions for a new medical degree, based on embracing disruptions, which would initially coexist with the current medical&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt; is well positioned to innovate education. Founded under free market ideals, the school is characterized by an entrepreneurial spirit and includes two business schools. As a private school without an endowment, tenured faculty, accreditation, or government funding, the school is optimized for&amp;nbsp;adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants included individuals supported by the &lt;a href="http://thielfoundation.org/" title="Thiel Foundation Homepage"&gt;Thiel Foundation&lt;/a&gt; as well as faculty from &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/" title="Harvard Medical School Homepage"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;, which offers student exchange with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several ideas came to the forefront as the forum&amp;nbsp;progressed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students should not complete a unit unless they have mastered the subject material. Variable learning rates are poorly accommodated by traditional academic&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development efforts should focus on the interactive portions of the curriculum. Consumption based learning can be outsourced. Open online courses provide world-class and cutting-edge education at little cost and enable coursework away from campus – for example, while providing care in the&amp;nbsp;countryside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctors should be just-in-time learners. Physicians need the ability to stay current in a rapidly changing field. The ability to effectively retrieve and integrate literature will be&amp;nbsp;crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology will continue to play a growing role in medicine eventually supplanting many of the current duties of a physician. Future physicians should be prepared to effectively embrace and explain these&amp;nbsp;technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients are costumers. Like any business, medicine should deliver services that the customer desires. Striving for customer satisfaction would help simplify the process of purchasing medical services and emphasize the often overlooked aspect of empathic&amp;nbsp;care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bioinformatics is an auspicious field given its low barriers to entry. Contracted bioinformatics projects could reduce tuition while providing an educational research experience for&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the &lt;a href="https://noticias.ufm.edu/cientificos-y-emprendedores-en-la-ufm/" title="Cientificos_y_emprendedores_en_la_UFM"&gt;opportunity to explore the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UFM&lt;/span&gt; campus&lt;/a&gt; and was thoroughly impressed by the design, hospitality, principles, and foresight of the institution. While visiting the campus, I was interviewed about my views on accessibility and communication in science.
