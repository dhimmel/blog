      The expeditionist&#8217;s 8 day itinerary for the Big Island of&nbsp;Hawaii
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">2019-01-25</span>

    <p>This post discloses an 8-day itinerary for exploring the Big Island, Hawaii. It is based on the expedition performed by @trang and I in January 2019. Of our 7 nights off the resort, we tent camped for six, which kept the combined lodging costs under&nbsp;$250.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> these adventures are not for the weak. Instead, these feats should only be attempted by a strong and frugal traveler, who is prepared to <em>leave no trace</em>. We reject commercial tourism and those that desecrate the Hawaiin wilderness using motorized contraptions. Hike or bike, but avoid disturbing what remains of nature by financing trucks, helicopters, and&nbsp;motorboats.</p>
<h2 id="map">Map</h2>
<p>We planned our trip by creating a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1n5mSaUnn9WsF_k7LGgF7n3Pc4xTQ45vO">custom map</a> of&nbsp;attractions:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1n5mSaUnn9WsF_k7LGgF7n3Pc4xTQ45vO"><img alt="custom map" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPL9K87SyxafiGTy78DPEB2jntUFz2C7JkoshqsnD46m6"></a></p>
<p>We decided to circumnavigate the island clockwise, beginning at Kona airport, where we rented the weakest car available from Hertz, a Nissan&nbsp;Versa.</p>
<h2 id="day-1-kealakekua-bay">Day 1: Kealakekua&nbsp;Bay</h2>
<p>We <a href="https://bigislandhikes.com/kealakekua-bay/">hiked to Kealakekua Bay</a>, with the Big Island&#8217;s best snorkeling and Captain Cook&#8217;s Monument. <a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ0Mzc4OQ==">Here&#8217;s our <span class="caps">GPS</span> track</a>. The hike is about 2 miles each way and&nbsp;scenic:</p>
<p><img alt="Kealakekua Bay Hiking" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYsyZTEB5n8Bd6Hh5Xmwb9v4yoTg9evxqPkwWZVucUBDo"></p>
<p>Francesca joined us for this part of the journey. She&#8217;s an Italian scientist currently living in Arizona, who performs some of the most advanced matrix computations for data integration in the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>At the bay, we found a nice hammock&nbsp;spot:</p>
<p><img alt="Kealakekua Bay Hammocking" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZcKeohzM1gJT7SWScfZvBxbihsKWgJzzUs93gTGFX6J8"></p>
<p>The main attraction however is the snorkeling. Put on some goggles, jump in, and witness your world transform into a colorful cacophony of marine mania. We didn&#8217;t get any pictures of the underwater view, but on shore the sun gave birth to crustacean&nbsp;reds:</p>
<p><img alt="crustacean reds" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmUWWYVTFimJaLZW4H6FxyujkHT9p9db241gaNVHnzrkoo"></p>
<p>We drove north this night and camped at <a href="https://hawaiicounty.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,details,57791.html">Mãhukona Beach Park</a>, which was somewhat sketch especially considering its $42 price tag for 2&nbsp;non-residents. </p>
<h2 id="day-2-pololu-valley-and-muliwai-trail">Day 2: Pololū Valley and Muliwai&nbsp;Trail</h2>
<p>We started day 2 with a <a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ3MjU2MA==">short hike</a> down to the beach at <a href="https://www.lovebigisland.com/pololu-valley/">Pololū Valley</a>. The view looking out towards the 7 valleys of the Kohala Volcana was impressive and a nice reminder of the wilderness we were about to&nbsp;explore.</p>
<p><img alt="MVIMG_20190109_082117.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQEtUVU2rpna1873PudY9u699mWtH31uy7721yb6qdpW4"></p>
<p>Next we drove around Kohala Volcana to reach Waipi’o Valley (the easternmost valley). From there we set out to hike the Muliwai Trail to <a href="https://bigislandhikes.com/waimanu-valley/">Waimanu Valley</a> (<a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ3MjU2MQ==">tracks</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="PANO_20190109_112824.vr.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSumm2jQPZzJKZeWa2FRr8pD3ESDHRU4AhGQMuFB45Rxf"></p>
<p>Check out @trang&#8217;s <a href="https://busy.org/@trang/zy5zezs6">amazing video</a> recounting our time at Waimanu Valley. The hike was&nbsp;scenic:</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_20190109_151729.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYYSCTFZ1aZ2KH8mAwMGUfnLtEXvf193f1vPdsYYiZp9W"></p>
<p>And&nbsp;wet&#8230;</p>
<p><img alt="rain on Muliwai Trail gif" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmR7uC1UNLw957FSqStyf1JKku9xXfBZqBm3hSSePUA12e"></p>
<p>And by the time we reached camp, <em>dark</em>. We stayed at campsite 1 (<a href="https://camping.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,map,31720.html">map download</a>), which was pretty good, although campsite 2 has the best view and fire pit, and served as the socialization venue for all the&nbsp;expeditions.</p>
<h2 id="day-3-waimanu-valley">Day 3: Waimanu&nbsp;Valley</h2>
<p>The view in the morning was worth&nbsp;it:</p>
<p><img alt="Waimanu Valley" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmeir78Pq3Su9xveWEkawjo6WXzhPNGBAZpDhRgsgdRPfN"></p>
<p>We continued along the valley perimeter along an unmaintained trail network to reach Waihilau Falls, the 14th tallest <a href="https://www.worldwaterfalldatabase.com/tallest-waterfalls/total-height">waterfall in the world</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Waihilau Falls" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmVYxrcccpcwAzTPjS4ThhUwUkZnvvAGVDJyq7F9MBgEd2"></p>
<p>Remember this is the jungle and the trek is&nbsp;treacherous:</p>
<p><img alt="spider webs" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmdzpqgcDpa5ticwK5vDq9t22J3QyWKrSuFYksF2UBhDu8"></p>
<p>That night we had a gathering of the vibes with other&nbsp;attendees.</p>
<h2 id="day-4-vacating-the-valleys">Day 4: Vacating the&nbsp;Valleys</h2>
<p>We hiked out early. By the way, did I mention there are two major water crossings: Waimanu Stream and Queen&#8217;s River. The beauty however is that you get to experience where the fresh meets the salt waters. Watch @trang cross Waimanu&nbsp;Stream:</p>
<p><img alt="waimanu-stream-crossing-reduced-size.gif" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmYYi7ttMD4xNv7ZkXBWHnvVjcQ8EbuTqyV2ft9ke2mz4H"></p>
<p>The hike out went smoothly. Overall, this outing comprised 22 miles of hiking and 10,600 feet of elevation&nbsp;gain.</p>
<p>That night we stayed at a cottage in Hilo, which despite costing over $100 was worse than every other spot we stayed. However, we were able to do laundry and rest up for our big ascent coming&nbsp;up.</p>
<h2 id="day-5-mauna-kea">Day 5: Mauna&nbsp;Kea</h2>
<p>We drove to the visitors station at Mauna Kea at an elevation of 9,200 feet. The Nissan Versa struggled to perform internal combustion at the lowered oxygen levels. From there, we began the hike to the summit of Mauna Kea, the highest peak in Hawaii at 13,803 feet and the tallest mountain in the world if plucked from the&nbsp;root.</p>
<p>Despite augmentation with 10 milligrams of acetazolamide, I felt elevation weakness, even at the visitation centre. Step by step, we ascended this dormant volcano and sacred landmark via the <a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/vis/visiting-mauna-kea/hiking.html">Humu&#8217;ula Trail</a>. We passed two other hikers on the way, who were unprepared in almost every way possible — inadequate sun protection, inadequate thermal layering, inadequate water supply, inadequate altitude acclimation. To the best of our knowledge, this couple never made it to the&nbsp;top.</p>
<p>On the way, we stopped by Lake Waiau, Hawaii&#8217;s only alpine lake and a place of great historical importance as ancient peoples would deposit umbilical cords of newborns here as a ritual to promote&nbsp;longevity.</p>
<p><img alt="PANO_20190112_141022.vr.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQhXajA1r6g7Fh69WSr4nNgPd1QPFzGjwrpJtTyuKPUXN"></p>
<p>A few other visitors stopped by and took a photo for&nbsp;us:</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmZ454LSxjQKXuC7r8tXc254p8bd8vVQnP8w7GynWYav3e"></p>
<p>However, one of the visitors kept throwing rocks in the lake, which annoyed me because the lake <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014EO140001" title="Tracking Dramatic Changes at Hawaii’s Only Alpine Lake. 2014">already struggles enough</a> with maintaining its&nbsp;depth.</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ3MjU2Mg==">total</a> of 6.5 miles, we reached the summit and enjoyed the&nbsp;views:</p>
<p><img alt="PANO_20190112_154537.vr.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmbP5E3dLSWm8RYbUoSLy7kYUcRbtTrG8YutGqV14yn3qx"></p>
<p>Mauna Kea is also special for being one of the premier sites on the earth for astronomical observation. The area surrounding the summit is currently home to 13 telescopic&nbsp;observatories:</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmTndUqNefcbAGdCmQinofgeqARXireyL3A65UAi89CkwF"></p>
<p>A telescope much greater than any of the existing telescopes has been planned. Its name: the Thirty Meter Telescope. However, there has been much resistance to this telescope and protesters halted the construction in 2015. Recently, court rulings <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-04444-2" title="Embattled Thirty Meter Telescope scores big win in Hawaii’s highest court">have sided</a> with the telescope. On our drive around the island, we saw many &#8220;Save Mauna Kea&#8221; signs advocating against the telescope. While I generally side with preservationists, I don&#8217;t see the merits of stopping this important eye into the sky and hence the history of the universe. Furthermore, the telescope will be recessed from the summit. Personally, I find the proposed design aesthetically pleasing and think it would contribute to the legacy and myth of the&nbsp;mountain.</p>
<p>We hitchhiked down and arrived to Nāmakanipaio Campground at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Due to special circumstances called partial government shutdown, the campground was not collecting fees. This happened to be the most luxurious car camping spot we stayed on the Big&nbsp;Island.</p>
<h2 id="day-6-volcanoes-national-park">Day 6: Volcanoes National&nbsp;Park</h2>
<p><img alt="shutdown-reduced-size.gif" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNeScFKNsUk2ErjcasrAwrkWm2JokcpBf5G1FPj7R5K6F"></p>
<p>Due to the longest government shutdown in <span class="caps">U.S.</span> history, a higher percent of the lands at Volcanoes National Park were forbidden than usual. Therefore, we are substituting this part with the itinerary we would have liked to do were the park fully&nbsp;open.</p>
<p>We had planned to hike the <a href="https://bigislandhikes.com/napau-trail/">Nāpau Trail</a> into the backcountry, where one can witness lava flows and steam&nbsp;vents:</p>
<p><img alt="steam-vents.gif" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmctx1HH6zAB1em7SBRskcWFdN4nm4khyPsPYB3m4hKW6M"></p>
<p>Behold the gigantic <em>Cibotium menziesii</em> (Hawaiian Tree&nbsp;Fern):</p>
<p><img alt="ferns png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmSkAs7s6gbPrUbH7vr14o4x7kH51dVWzV355gR32RFsz3"></p>
<p>Instead we had to settle for some déjà vu backcountry&nbsp;solitude:</p>
<p><img alt="tent setup png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmauAtXQWNqbvF1DJtNsqwM3yxsj77z33CmfojDde8YrMz"></p>
<h2 id="day-7-volcanoes-national-park">Day 7: Volcanoes National&nbsp;Park</h2>
<p>We did get to walk along Rim Drive to get a nice vantage point of Kīlauea&nbsp;Crater. </p>
<p><img alt="PANO_20190114_125845.vr.jpg" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmaRy6732QUvNfUL6FGeKz6moZbjzxymx2NbF2D934DSHp"></p>
<p>After seeping lava continuously for 35 years, Kīlauea and its subordinates <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aav7046" title="The 2018 rift eruption and summit collapse of Kīlauea Volcano">experienced</a> increased volcanic activity last summer. During this period, the magma exhausted itself. Hence, there was no lava anywhere on the Big Island for the duration of our&nbsp;visit.</p>
<p>On the night of day 7, we camped at <a href="https://hawaiicounty.ehawaii.gov/camping/all,details,57795.html">Whittington Beach Park</a>, which was scenic and only very slightly sketch. We dined at both the southernmost bakery and southernmost restaurant in the United States (both recommended), located in the town of&nbsp;Naalehu.</p>
<h2 id="day-8">Day&nbsp;8</h2>
<p>On day 8, we made it near the southernmost point in the United States. We <a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/OTQ5NjczMg==">hiked</a> to the Green Sand&nbsp;Beach:</p>
<p><img alt="green sand selfie.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNQuUdRz4niJTTrizqVtrdPZQNhu13ob9BkNAhfcArAeW"></p>
<p>I was happy to see most other visitors hiking rather than purchasing a ride on a 4×4, since the automobiles do considerable damage to the landscape, which made for a nice&nbsp;photo:</p>
<p><img alt="green sand beach ruts.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/Qmexm1z5t2VxQf78mJ47qYwRB34Rr1LbbsSyKs8GR7A67F"></p>
<p>On the hike we were reminded of the onslaught of plastic pollution humans are littering the ocean&nbsp;with:</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmXWHfRdZDBBkphgcGnMCkxMD2t9eD1CJHz5RghkP2YJVm"></p>
<p>We must all do our part to address this crisis. @trang and I pick up as much litter as possible when traveling and around the streets of Philly. On the bright side, people are waking up to the issue and are prototyping solutions. For the second time, we just missed sighting <a href="https://www.theoceancleanup.com/">The Ocean Cleanup</a>&#8216;s System 001, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOceanCleanup/status/1086220492351115264">brought</a> to Hilo Harbor for repairs a couple days after we passed&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>Then we went to the southernmost point cliff jump where there were many fishermen but few jumpers. I was worried that the moderately high surf would make connecting with the ladder following the 40-foot jump dangerous. But, @trang decided she was doing it regardless. I asked her whether she&#8217;d ever jumped from a high height. She said&nbsp;&#8220;no&#8221;.</p>
<p>So we walked the plank, me then&nbsp;her.</p>
<p><img alt="dhimmel plank.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmPiCLLiQVjcwMAjFi6DsneRcqisRioPyAzvMykrtyXYnN"></p>
<p><img alt="trang plank.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmejsjfHGv1KmFpvDPXPzEejuJGN9QDBKSfqcmsapNMwJS"></p>
<p>We both enjoyed the jump. Although, I think @trang will make sure to have a more streamlined landing on her next jump! Finally we drove north, snorkeled at Honaunau Beach, and ate rambutan before hopping on a red eye flight back to the&nbsp;mainland.</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<p>We were in Hawaii before this vacation for a conference called the <a href="https://psb.stanford.edu/">Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing</a>. At the conference, I led a <a href="https://slides.com/dhimmel/psb/">working group</a> on Manubot, where participants learned how to use Manubot for collaboratively writing a <a href="https://git.dhimmel.com/psb-manuscript/">manuscript</a>.</p>
<p>During this time we checked out some local attractions such as Hapuna Beach. We even rented convertible BMWs, which were free to&nbsp;borrow:</p>
<p><img alt="bmw-biking.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmQtLJhHnK36iQtiY2oxTnLdyx8YBhBMfo2M5deZ1JasMs"></p>
<p>Makalawena Beach was nice and included a resident seal. We imitated petroglyphs with our&nbsp;shadows: </p>
<p><img alt="Makalawena Beach shadows.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmNR2m7dDNWVag99BAG1rpe6RV1GVR1Dn62NaVThJCeAJE"></p>
<p>Sunset walking back from Makalawena Beach was&nbsp;picturesque:</p>
<p><img alt="sunset.png" src="https://ipfs.busy.org/ipfs/QmU66T7mQgTAaaq974SV5piefFm8yEepbWw3vcBSTABcdB"></p>
<p>We had parked at the southern trailhead. Apparently, the park closes at 7:00 <span class="caps">PM</span>. Be out by then. A security personal tailgated us for 10 minutes with great rage. To this person&#8217;s dismay, we cleared the gates at 6:59 <span class="caps">PM</span>, so he was not able to ticket&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>In conclusion, sea&nbsp;turtles:</p>
