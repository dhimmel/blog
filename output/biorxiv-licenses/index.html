      The licensing of <i>bioRxiv</i>&nbsp;preprints
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">December 05, 2016</span>

    <p>Jordan Anaya of <a href="http://www.omnesres.com/" title="Jordan Anaya is OmniRes">Omnes Res</a> — creator of the <a href="http://www.prepubmed.org/" title="PrePubMed indexes preprints from arXiv q-bio, PeerJ Preprints, Figshare, bioRxiv, F1000Research, preprints.org, and The Winnower">PrePubMed</a> search engine for biomedical preprints — <a href="https://medium.com/@OmnesRes/biorxiv-vs-peerj-preprints-f7589141c532" title="bioRxiv vs. PeerJ Preprints">recently compared</a> <em>bioRxiv</em> to <em>PeerJ Preprints</em>. We agree that <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/" title="PeerJ Preprints"><em>PeerJ</em></a> offers the better technology and user experience. However, <a href="http://biorxiv.org/" title="The Preprint Server for Biology"><em>bioRxiv</em></a> has greater adoption in the biodata&nbsp;sciences.</p>
<p>In fact, since my last blog post on preprints at the beginning of 2016, <em>bioRxiv</em> has grown by 149% from 2,785 to 6,933 preprints. The growth has been fueled largely by the efforts of <a href="http://asapbio.org/" title="A scientist-driven initiative to promote the productive use of preprints in the life sciences">ASAPbio</a> and the growing recognition that <a href="https://blog.dhimmel.com/history-of-delays/" title="The history of publishing delays">publishing delays</a> are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/530148a" title="Does it take too long to publish research?">interfering with science</a>.</p>
<p>While <em>PeerJ</em> requires that all preprints are published under a Creative Commons Attribution (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span></a>) License, <em>bioRxiv</em> allows authors to choose from five options: <span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/"><span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span>-<span class="caps">ND</span></a> <small>(Attribution-NoDerivatives)</small>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span>-<span class="caps">NC</span></a> <small>(Attribution-NonCommercial)</small>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"><span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span>-<span class="caps">NC</span>-<span class="caps">ND</span></a> <small>(Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives)</small>, and no license <small>(all rights reserved)</small>.</p>
<p>The purpose of Creative Commons licenses is to allow the reuse of content that would otherwise be prohibited by copyright. As a result, the open licensing of preprints is crucial for the growth of open access, the movement to make publicly-funded research articles available to and reusable by the&nbsp;public.</p>
<h2 id="license-breakdown">License&nbsp;breakdown</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, of the five options offered by <em>bioRxiv</em>, <span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span> is the only <a href="https://opendefinition.org/licenses/" title="Open Definition Conformant Licenses">open license</a>, which <a href="https://opendefinition.org/" title="The Open Definition sets out principles that define “openness” in relation to data and content">requires</a> that content &#8220;can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose.&#8221; Therefore, with the help of Jordan Anaya, I looked into which licensing options authors were choosing for their <em>bioRxiv</em> preprints (till the end of November 2016). The breakdown shows that there&#8217;s major room for improvement <small>(<a href="#license-implications">see why license choices matter below</a>)</small>.</p>

<h3 id="licenses-over-time">Licenses over&nbsp;time</h3>
<p>Next, I looked to see whether <em>bioRxiv</em> preprints were becoming more open over time. They weren&#8217;t. In fact, the proportion of <span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span> licenses has been in decline since mid&nbsp;2014.</p>
<div id="date-figure"></div>

<h3 id="licenses-by-subject">Licenses by&nbsp;subject</h3>
<p>What about licensing by discipline? The figure below shows all subjects with at least 100 preprints. Bioinformatics appears to be the most open, whereas Cell Biology is the least&nbsp;open.</p>
<div id="subject-figure"></div>

<h2 id="the-biorxiv-leaderboard">The <em>bioRxiv</em>&nbsp;leaderboard</h2>
<p>Using the scoring system <a href="#license-table">above</a>, I assigned each preprint a score based on its license. Each author received a score equaling the sum of their&nbsp;preprints.</p>
<p>Middle initials were removed to consolidate duplicate names for the same person. If you&#8217;re worried that this analysis conflates multiple authors with the same name, start using <a href="https://orcid.org/" title="Persistent digital identifiers for every researcher"><span class="caps">ORCID</span></a>. Luckily, with only 29,436 distinct author names, name collisions are yet to be a major&nbsp;problem.</p>

<p>Congratulations to <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/mark-daly" title="Mark Daly at the Broad Institute">Mark Daly</a> of the Broad Institute for leading both in terms of number of preprints and score. Also notable was <a href="http://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html" title="Bloom Lab at Fred Hutch">Jesse Bloom</a> of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who&#8217;s posted 10 preprints, all under <span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span>. Condolences to my advisor, <a href="http://www.greenelab.com/casey" title="Casey Greene · Greene Lab at the University of Pennsylvania">Casey Greene</a>, whose unfortunate decision to post <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/051524" title="Pathway and network-based strategies to translate genetic discoveries into effective therapies">one</a> of his 11 <em>bioRxiv</em> preprints under all rights reserved kept him out of the top&nbsp;10.</p>
<h2 id="license-implications">License&nbsp;implications</h2>
<p>Why are only a paltry 17.8% of <em>bioRxiv</em> preprints openly licensed? Perhaps many authors are unaware of the implications of their&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s important to note that these licenses affect copyright, which only covers the original works of authorship in the preprint, such as writing and figures. The licenses do not affect whether others can use the knowledge or inventions presented in the preprint. If you want to prevent others from using your discoveries, you&#8217;ll need a&nbsp;patent.</p>
<p>Second, many preprints go on to be published in subscription journals where authors transfer copyright or grant the journal an exclusive license to publish. In essence, they forfeit their copyrights. As a consequence, openly licensing your preprint is the best way to ensure that <em>you yourself</em> retain the right to reuse&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, most researchers care about getting citations and preventing plagiarism. However, the Attribution clause (<span class="caps">BY</span>) of Creative Commons Licenses is sufficient, which is <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" title="Human-readable summary of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International">summarized as</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your&nbsp;use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">NC</span> or <span class="caps">ND</span> stipulations provide no additional protection against plagiarism. And anyways, scholarly norms rather than threats of being sued are what <a href="https://dancohen.org/2013/11/26/cc0-by/" title="Dan Cohen Blog · CC0 (+BY)">actually encourages</a> attribution. If you want to maximize citations, choose the license that allows for maximum&nbsp;dissemination.</p>
<h3 id="all-rights-reserved">All rights&nbsp;reserved</h3>
<p>29.8% of <em>bioRxiv</em> preprints are all rights reserved, placing a large portion of the <em>bioRxiv</em> corpus in the same troublesome legal situation as traditional academic&nbsp;publishing.</p>
<p>Copying or distributing these preprints is copyright infringement, exposing well-intentioned scientists to legal peril. Diego Gomez —  who was a master&#8217;s student in Colombia 🇨🇴 — <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/07/colombian-grad-student-faces-jail-sharing-thesis-online" title="Colombian grad student faces jail for sharing a thesis online">learned this the hard way</a>, when in 2011 he posted a thesis on Scribd to share with colleagues. Now Deigo&#8217;s legal nightmare has lasted for more than two years, and he&#8217;s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/10/over-two-years-later-diego-gomezs-ongoing-case-shows-need-global-reforms" title="Over Two Years Later, Diego Gomez’s Ongoing Case Shows the Need for Global Reforms">still facing</a> the potential of a 4–8 year jail&nbsp;sentence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in almost all cases, it&#8217;s in the researcher&#8217;s best interest to license their preprints. The benefits for the preprint are many, including decreasing the friction for: other scientists to share, disseminate, or present it; search engines to index and display it; and text mining corpuses to include&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Should <em>bioRxiv</em> cease to exist, preserving these unlicensed preprints would be fraught with risk. Who wants to look back in their elder years to see their past research <a href="https://oadoi.org/10.1111/jels.12057" title="How Copyright Keeps Works Disappeared">disappeared</a>? And in the case of publicly-funded research, there&#8217;s an ethical imperative to make it freely available and&nbsp;reusable.</p>
<h3 id="non-commercial">Non-commercial</h3>
<p>75.0% of <em>bioRxiv</em> preprints forbid commercial use. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.150.2189" title="Creative Commons licenses and the non-commercial condition: Implications for the re-use of biodiversity information">ambiguity</a> of what qualifies as commercial dissuades potential users. But commercial use is awesome — it means that someone has found a way to add enough value to your work that others will pay for it. And unless you plan on selling your preprint, there&#8217;s zero opportunity&nbsp;cost.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re quickly entering an era where scientific literature is read first by a computer, and then second, if at all, by a human. As <a href="http://chjh.nl/" title="Chris Hartgerink's Homepage">Chris Hartgerink</a> — <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/527413f" title="Text-mining block prompts online response">a text miner</a> in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 who purchased legal insurance during his PhD — explains, &#8220;<span class="caps">NC</span> restricts the value of text and data mining outputs by limiting the potential applications of the&nbsp;method.&#8221;</p>
<h3 id="no-derivatives">No&nbsp;derivatives</h3>
<p>73.7% of <em>bioRxiv</em> preprints forbid derivatives. A derivative could be that someone likes your figure and wants to modify it. Or someone wants to translate your preprint into a different language. Even more so than <span class="caps">NC</span>, <span class="caps">ND</span> stipulations are <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Wiki/cc_license_compatibility" title="Creative Commons License Compatibility">incompatible</a> with other licenses, making it difficult to remix or combine&nbsp;content.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do">What can I&nbsp;do?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Choose <span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span> in the future. If you&#8217;ve posted any preprints that aren&#8217;t <span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span>, you can submit a revision on <em>bioRxiv</em> to update the license (assuming that you still own the rights and the work hasn&#8217;t been published by a&nbsp;journal).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about some nebulous risk to open licensing, just remember that there are already <a href="https://stateof.creativecommons.org/2015/" title="State of the Commons 2015">over a quarter billion</a> <span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span> licensed works. <small>Note that if your preprint includes content that you don&#8217;t own the rights to and that isn&#8217;t compatibly licensed, you&#8217;ll have to seek permission or take a wager on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use" title="Wikipedia · Fair use">fair use</a>.</small></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Funders:</strong> Require open! See the Gates Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Open-Access-Policy" title="Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Open Access Policy">policy</a> as an&nbsp;example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Preprint Servers:</strong> Remove the all rights reserved option. Consider replacing it with <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"><span class="caps">CC0</span></a> <small>(Public Domain Dedication)</small>, which is ideal for preprints by <span class="caps">US</span> Government employees 🇺🇸, whose work is not subject to copyright under <span class="caps">US</span> law but would <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2014/05/09/white-house-supports-cc0-for-federal-government-datasets/" title="White House supports CC0 for federal government datasets">still benefit</a> from <span class="caps">CC0</span>&nbsp;internationally.</p>

<p>Preprints are an exciting development in scholarly communication. Now let&#8217;s start off down the right&nbsp;track.</p>

<p><strong>Update on March 29, 2017:</strong> Jessica Polka, Director of ASAPbio, <a href="#comment-3215911237">noticed</a> that <em>bioRxiv</em> reordered their license options so the more open licenses now appear first (as I suggested in the comments below). Accordingly, I <a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/biorxiv-licenses/blob/16cdfccef4ac1fb30cfb3de784b686659ce1de52/3.impact.ipynb" title="Jupyter notebook on GitHub: bioRxiv license choices, before &amp; after the blog post">compared</a> the distribution of licenses for the 100 days preceding this blog post to the 100 days following this blog post. The proportion of <span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span> licenses increased from 13.7% to 21.1% (<em>p</em> = 1.67 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Based on this effect, I estimate this blog post led to <strong>153 additional <span class="caps">CC</span> <span class="caps">BY</span> preprints</strong> in the 100 days following its&nbsp;publication!</p>

<p><strong>Update on June 16, 2017:</strong> ASAPbio just <a href="http://asapbio.org/licensing" title="ASAPbio launches preprint licensing task force. 2017-06-16">announced</a> they&#8217;re launching a licensing taskforce, which I&#8217;m excited to be part of. <em>Nature News</em> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2017.22161" title="Lindsay McKenzie.
