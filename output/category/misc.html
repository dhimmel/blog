    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">January 15, 2015</span>

    <p>We would like to thank <em>Cancer Research <span class="caps">UK</span></em> for their cancer related advocacy and <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2015/01/14/does-oxygen-cause-lung-cancer-i-wouldnt-hold-your-breath/" title="Does oxygen cause lung cancer?">their coverage</a> of our <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705" title="Lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation">recent publication</a>. However, we find several aspects of their interpretation&nbsp;troubling.</p>
<p>First, we find it unwise to discount our study because it analyzed counties rather than individuals. As <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jech.54.5.326" title="The ecological fallacy strikes back">Professor Pearce explains</a>, much of our current understanding of cancer risk arose initially from <strong>ecological studies</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Historically, the key area in which epidemiologists have been able to &#8220;add value&#8221; has been through this population focus, although this lesson has been forgotten by many modern epidemiologists. For example, many of the recent discoveries on the causes of cancer (including dietary factors and colon cancer, hepatitis B and liver cancer, aflatoxins and liver cancer, human papilloma virus and cervical cancer) have their origins, directly or indirectly, in the systematic international comparisons of cancer incidence conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. These suggested hypotheses concerning the possible causes of the international patterns, which were investigated in more depth in further studies. In some instances these hypotheses were consistent with biological knowledge at the time, but in other instances they were new and striking, and might not have been proposed, or investigated further, if the population level analyses had not been&nbsp;done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compared to these influential studies of the past, our study benefitted from smaller population units (counties, not states as Ms. Osgun asserts), greater data availability, greater adjustment for potential confounding factors, and modern statistical techniques. Nonetheless, we view our findings as a starting point for further epidemiological and experimental research. In the meantime, we view oxygen-driven tumorigenesis as the most plausible explanation based on established knowledge regarding the underlying&nbsp;biology.</p>
<p>The notion of oxygen as a carcinogen is neither radical nor novel, as evidenced by the 1978 <em>Nature</em> letter titled, &#8220;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/274606a0" title="Are physiological oxygen concentrations mutagenic?">Are physiological oxygen concentrations mutagenic?</a>&#8221; (Hint: <em>Nature</em> rarely publishes negative results). Our study alone <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-2">cites</a> over a dozen studies supporting oxygen&#8217;s direct role in carcinogenesis. The evidence spans the spectrum from molecular to cellular to organismal and to clinical. Inspired molecular oxygen results in intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species, which lead to mutations. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019785" title="Ambient Oxygen Promotes Tumorigenesis">Recent research</a> found mice that were predisposed to cancer took twice as long to develop tumors when housed in low-oxygen chambers. Finally, oxygen toxicity in the human lung is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1378/chest.88.6.900" title="Pulmonary oxygen toxicity">well documented</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2005.03.008" title="Childhood Cancer Following Neonatal Oxygen Supplementation">childhood cancer increases following neonatal oxygen supplementation</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to <strong>biological plausibility</strong>, the criticism identifies four other characteristics of strong epidemiological evidence. We believe our study satisfies these&nbsp;criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Accounting for other factors</strong>: For lung cancer, we included <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705/table-1" title="Table 1: Predictor information and inclusion.">11 factors</a> in addition to elevation to adjust for important demographic and cancer-risk factors. These factors include established risk factors (such as smoking, radon, and pollution), lifestyle variables (such as obesity, education, income, and race), and demographics (such as percent male and whether the county is metropolitan). We didn&#8217;t include an age variable because our cancer rates were already age-adjusted to the 2000-census population. Furthermore, the inverse association persisted when we performed the analysis separately within each of the ten states, for males and females, and for those over and under 65 years of age. Since the causal factor appeared to affect every county, every state, both sexes, and all ages, pervasive environmental variables were the most likely confounders. Thus, we evaluated seven environmental variables such as <span class="caps">UVB</span> exposure, temperature, and precipitation. All seven alternative variables produced models over one billion times less likely than the elevation-including&nbsp;model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large numbers</strong>: The probability of our observed association between lung cancer and elevation occurring by chance is less than one in a quadrillion. After filtering counties to only those with high-quality data, 253 counties remained for lung cancer. In the year 2000, these 253 counties had a combined population of 59,659,978, hardly a small&nbsp;number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unbiased</strong>: We minimized potential biases from a variety of angles. Counties with high migration rates and Native American composition <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705/supp-1" title="Quality Control Filters">were filtered</a>. Counties with populations below 10,000 &#8212; whose measurements had greater margins of error &#8212; were excluded, and the remaining counties were weighted by population in the analysis. Finally, we carefully selected the Western United States to minimize extraneous variation, which could cause bias, while capturing the variation in elevation of this mountainous&nbsp;region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong>: By definition, every breakthrough finding in science has yet to be reproduced upon discovery. We encourage replication on different regions and with different study designs. Our entire dataset, analysis pipeline, results, and codebase are public to make this task easier for&nbsp;others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The criticism mentions the <strong>lag time</strong> between exposure to cigarette smoke and lung cancer as a potential confounder and considers the recency of our smoking data as the &#8220;likely&#8221; culprit behind elevation&#8217;s association with lung cancer. Let us destruct this argument using data. To assess the change in smoking, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1478-7954-12-5" title="Cigarette smoking prevalence in US counties: 1996-2012">we collected county smoking prevalences for 1996 and 2012</a>. For the counties included in our lung cancer analysis, county smoking prevalence in 1996 was tightly linked to smoking prevalence in 2012 (first panel below). In other words, county smoking prevalences are relatively stable over time and were older smoking data available to us, the effect on our findings would likely be minimal. Next, we found that elevation was only <em>slightly</em> correlated with change in smoking rates over the 16 year period (second panel). For the lag time issue to present a serious omitted-variable bias, elevation and change in smoking would have to be <em>strongly</em> correlated. Finally, we evaluated the correlation between change in smoking and each of the 17 variables included in our lung cancer models. We found that six variables are more correlated with change in smoking than elevation (third panel). In other words, even if the lag time issue were capable of creating a spurious association between elevation and lung cancer, any of six variables we accounted for would prevent this&nbsp;outcome.</p>
<p><img alt="Smoking Analysis" src="http://dhimmel.com/wp-content/uploads/smoking-lagtime.png" title="Smoking Analysis" /></p>
<p>Finally, we would like to conclude by reiterating a few points from the paper. First, the elevation association was specific to lung cancer and did not extend to breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, providing evidence for an inhaled carcinogen. Second, the magnitude of the association was large, second only to smoking and responsible for a 12.7% decrease in lung cancer incidence for an 1000 meter rise. The likelihood of spurious associations, and especially ecological fallacy, decreases with effect size. Third, we performed extensive measures to avoid confounding, such as the <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-42">stratification</a> and <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/705/#p-45">subgrouping</a> analyses, which Ms. Osgun fails to address. Finally, our publication is open access with a public peer review history, and we released our entire <a href="https://github.com/dhimmel/elevcan" title="Project GitHub Repository">code, analysis, and results</a>. We took these measures to allow independent verification and evidence-based data-driven reanalysis rather than&nbsp;speculation.</p>

    <p>For the past two years, <a href="http://www.ksimeonov.com/" title="Kamen Simeonov Homepage">Kamen Simeonov</a> and I have been working on a project codenamed <em>The Lung</em>. Today is <em>PeerJ Publication Day</em> and the results of our research are now&nbsp;online:</p>

<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>In this study, we investigated whether cancer rates varied with altitude. Our primary focus was lung cancer, since the lung comes into direct contact with inhaled air and the level of atmospheric oxygen decreases with elevation. The same reactivity of oxygen that makes it an ideal input for respiration also risks causing cellular damage and mutation. Therefore, we evaluated whether inhaled oxygen is a human carcinogen by investigating the association between cancer and elevation. We analyzed ~250 counties in the Western United States, where the mountainous terrain results in varying elevations and high quality county data is&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>We found that lung cancer decreased dramatically with rising elevation. This trend did not extend to breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer supporting our hypothesis that the elevation-dependent carcinogen is inhaled. The association between lung cancer and elevation remained after accounting for potential confounding factors, such as smoking, pollution, and obesity. Additionally, other environmental variables that could protect against lung cancer, such as <span class="caps">UVB</span> exposure (an indicator of sunlight-induced vitamin D synthesis), were unable to replace the effect of&nbsp;elevation.</p>
<p>To convey the magnitude of the observed association, we imagine a hypothetical situation where the entire United States elevates to the level of the highest <span class="caps">US</span> county (San Juan, Colorado at 3,473 meters / 11,395 feet). Were all other factors to remain constant, we estimate 65,496 fewer new cases of lung cancer would arise per year. For comparison, 224,210 new cases of lung cancer <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3322/caac.21208" title="Cancer statistics, 2014">arose</a> in the United States last&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>While we don&#8217;t recommend anyone relocate just yet and the risk for nonsmokers is low, experimental confirmation of oxygen-driven tumorgenesis could lead to new insights that yield better lung cancer preventions and treatment.

    <span class="post-date">September 15, 2014</span>

    <p>One network, with which many of my readers are familiar, is Facebook. At its core, Facebook is a network (graph) of users (nodes) connected by friendships (edges). Each user exists and experiences content within the confines of their Facebook subgraph, the portion of the network consisting of their friends. When analyzed properly, an individual&#8217;s friendship network paints a historical picture of his or her social&nbsp;engagement.</p>
<p>Here I&#8217;ve created my Facebook friendship network. Nodes represents my friends, and edges represent their friendships. My network contains 1,278 friends with 40,255 friendships amongst themselves. Nearly all of my friends belong to the giant connected component displayed below. Node size indicates degree (number of mutual friends). I applied a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098679" title="ForceAtlas2 Publication - PLOS ONE">force-directed layout</a> to organize the network: highly connected nodes are pulled together, while distantly connected nodes are&nbsp;repulsed.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would have manually categorized my friends into communities. However, to save time, I classified friends using a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/P10008" title="Fast unfolding of communities in large networks">community detection algorithm</a>. The algorithm succeeded in partitioning my friends into communities (denoted by color) that coincided with my past social&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<p><img alt="Facebook Friendship Network" src="http://dhimmel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/friendship-network.jpg" title="Facebook Friendship Network" /></p>
<p>Several interesting phenomena are revealed. The two largest clusters correspond to childhood and college, two highly social and prolonged eras of my life. My hometown friends formed two communities: those who graduated highschool in 2007 or before (purple) and those who graduated after 2007 (blue). My maternal kindred are tightly clustered forming their own community (dark green): my mom is one of sixteen siblings. My brother is the intermediate blue node between my hometown and kin clusters. I went to summer camp for nearly a decade in New Hampshire. These friends (light green community) are proximal but separate from my hometown friends. My 300-mile journey to a college full of new acquaintances manifests in a cluster distant from the rest of the network. At Cornell, I joined a fraternity as well as the debate team. However, only debate forms its own community reflecting the greater social isolation of that activity. Finally, my colleagues and classmates at <span class="caps">UCSF</span> are tightly clustered. The distant offshoot from this cluster represents the individuals I met while participating in a <a href="http://dhimmel.com/blog/innovation-in-medical-education-forum/" title="Innovation in Medical Education Forum">medical education forum in Guatemala</a>.</p>
<p>I encourage my readers to play around with their own friendship networks. One interesting aspect is discovering the friends which bridge one&#8217;s various communities. Additionally, unconnected nodes most commonly indicate serendipitous encounters or sockpuppet accounts. I used the <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/netvizz/" title="Facebook netvizz App">netvizz app</a> to extract my friendship network from Facebook and <a href="https://gephi.github.io/" title="Gephi Homepage">Gephi</a> for&nbsp;visualization.</p>
