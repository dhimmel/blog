## Source of the Satoshi Village blog

[Satoshi Village](http://blog.dhimmel.com) is [Daniel Himmelstein](http://dhimmel.com)'s personal blog.

The blog is created using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) -- a static site generator, written in Python. This program allows posts to be written in markdown and easily converted into html pages.

The theme is a slightly modified version of [Pelicanyan](https://github.com/thomaswilley/pelicanyan), which is a port of Jekyll's [Lanyon Theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/).

The blog is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which serves the `gh-pages` branch of the repository. The custom subdomain of `blog.dhimmel.com` is specified in top-level `CNAME` file in `gh-pages`.
