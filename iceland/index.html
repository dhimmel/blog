      Thru-hiking Skógar to Leirubakki: the longest marked trek in&nbsp;Iceland
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">2019-07-29</span>

    <p><em>Iceland&#8217;s longest continuous marked trail, some say. Where the night is not, the wind wails, the rain rages, and geysers&nbsp;gurgle.</em></p>
<p>Starting June 15, 2019, I hiked from Skógar to Leirubakki in Iceland. My five day trek covered the following connected&nbsp;trails:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fimmvörðuháls Trail (Skógar and Þórsmörk, 24&nbsp;km)</li>
<li>Laugavegur Trail (Þórsmörk to Landmannalaugar, 63&nbsp;km)</li>
<li>Hellismannaleið Trail (Landmannalaugar to Rjúpnavellir, 55&nbsp;km)</li>
<li>Hellismannaleið Trail Extension (Rjúpnavellir to Leirubakki, 25&nbsp;km)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The hike totaled 167 kilometers (104 miles, <a href="https://my.viewranger.com/track/details/MTA5MTgwODA="><span class="caps">GPS</span> track</a>) across many highlights of the Southern Icelandic&nbsp;wilderness:</p>
<p><img alt="ViewRanger GPS Track: 2019-06-15 Skogar to Leirubakki in Iceland" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/01-viewranger-gps-track.png"></p>
<p>While Iceland is home to many <a href="https://www.kimkim.com/c/the-best-multi-day-hikes-in-iceland">multi-day hikes</a>, I chose this Southern excursion due to its accessible logistics and the recommendations of my trusted counsel: Hayden the nomadic giant; Tómas the native, Andersen the nice; and Jake the ultralight&nbsp;introvert.</p>
<p>As I would learn along the way, my path traversed Iceland&#8217;s longest continuous marked hiking trail system. Please comment if this assertion is incorrect or if it is possible to extend this trek&nbsp;further.</p>
<p>I hiked northbound for additional flexibility, since it provided more potential exit points while ensuring I covered the two most popular segments: the Fimmvörðuháls and Laugavegur trails. While these trails were magnificent, they were also crowded. So if you seek solitude in nature and more opportunities for wild camping, consider the Hellismannaleið trail and its&nbsp;extension.</p>
<p>Icelandic names take a bit of repetition and practice to get used to. This picture of bus routes may be somewhat helpful in seeing how the destinations I mention are&nbsp;oriented:</p>
<p><img alt="Trex.is Bus Route Map" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/02-trexis-bus-route-map.jpg"></p>
<p>I began in Skógar near the Southern coast. Going into the hike, I expected the named villages along the route to be towns. However, in general they were a couple buildings, usually belonging to a single seasonal establishment. Since mid June is early in the season, with substantial snowpack in many areas, several of the villages were still dormant. Hence, it&#8217;s best to carry everything you need and expect little infrastructure along the&nbsp;way.</p>
<h2 id="fimmvoruhals-trail">Fimmvörðuháls&nbsp;Trail</h2>
<p>I met several other hikers on the bus from Reykjavík to Skógar. We posed for a quick picture before setting&nbsp;off:</p>
<p><img alt="hikers starting in Skógar" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/03-hikers-starting-in-skogar.jpg"></p>
<p>On the first day, I hiked with a French medic (black fleece above). At one point, he asked whether we should take a break to eat, to which I replied, &#8220;I already ate.&#8221; The wonders of multitasking while&nbsp;walking!</p>
<p>The landscapes were&nbsp;expansive.</p>
<p><img alt="Fimmvörðuháls Trail marker" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/04-fimmvorduhals-trail-marker.jpg"></p>
<p>The water, rocks, snow, vegetation, and clouds formed compositions of earthen&nbsp;colors:</p>
<p><img alt="waterfall" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/05-waterfall.jpg"></p>
<p>At altitude, the mist and snow merged into a ghostly&nbsp;gray:</p>
<p><img alt="rocks snow in the cloud" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/06-rocks-snow-in-cloud.jpg"></p>
<p>On the way down, the tectonic textures did not&nbsp;disappoint:</p>
<p><img alt="hillslope jigsaw" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/07-hillslope-jigsaw.jpg"></p>
<p>This rock formation appeared deceivingly&nbsp;anthropomorphic:</p>
<p><img alt="rock formation" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/08-rock-formation.jpg"></p>
<p>That night, the Frenchman and I camped at the Básar campground in Þórsmörk. With a nice forest canopy and valley basin to shelter us from the ever-present elements of light and wind, I entered a deep and sustained&nbsp;slumber.</p>
<p>This was the only night where sleep was pleasant. Perhaps the greatest battle going forward was the dreaded night where no amount of exhaustion, melatonin, or earplugs could overcome the forces of restlessness in these everlit arctic&nbsp;borderlands.</p>
<h2 id="laugavegur-trail">Laugavegur&nbsp;Trail</h2>
<p>The next morning I set out alone, as I would be for the remainder of the&nbsp;hike.</p>
<p><img alt="Laugavegur trail sign" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/09-laugavegur-trail-sign.jpg"></p>
<p>Early in the day, I crossed a stream with my shoes on, for convenience not necessity. Wet sneakers pushed me close to my blister threshold, and for the remainder of the hike I applied maximum blister prevention, consisting of taping hotspots with Leukotape P, crossing streams barefoot or circumnavigating them, and wearing Injinji toe socks as a&nbsp;liner.</p>
<p>Later in the day, I crossed the behemoth Bláfjallakvísl river&nbsp;barefoot:</p>
<p><img alt="Big Stream Crossing" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/10-big-stream-crossing.jpg"></p>
<p>A warden I met afterwards said this is the one water crossing where he recommends footwear. It is also a <a href="https://youtu.be/44vcCQr6V88">road crossing</a> and is wide. The frigidity rushed me forward against the competing objective of carefully selecting my&nbsp;footing.</p>
<p>Some unfiltered water was more delicious than&nbsp;others:</p>
<p><img alt="Water Refill" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/11-water-refill.jpg"></p>
<p>A great valley carved by rushing water revealed a red underbelly to the green&nbsp;surface:</p>
<p><img alt="red in cliffside" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/12-red-in-cliffside.jpg"></p>
<p>The snow had&nbsp;horns:</p>
<p><img alt="snow horns" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/13-snow-horns.jpg"></p>
<p>It was rumored that camping outside of established campgrounds, which charge fees if in operation, is prohibited on the Laugavegur trail. However, after 20 plus miles on the day, I arrived to the Álftavatn huts next to an alpine lake of the same name. I was shocked by the location of the campsites, which seemed to be directly in the line of fire of the fierce winds accelerating from over the&nbsp;lake.</p>
<p>So I continued on and slept (or attempted to) aside a large boulder a bit off the&nbsp;trail:</p>
<p><img alt="Offtrail Campsite" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/14-offtrail-campsite.jpg"></p>
<p>Nature would punish me for my possibly prohibited cowboy camping. By time I gave up on sleeping around 4 <span class="caps">AM</span>, my quilt was dripping with condensation. Apparently, my intuition that clear skies would mean little dew was&nbsp;incorrect.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, not more than 20 minutes into hiking, I encountered a rugged stream crossing. Have I mentioned that Iceland is cold, especially when the sun makes its brief dip below the&nbsp;horizon?</p>
<p>But at the top of the pass, I was rewarded with a steam&nbsp;shadow:</p>
<p><img alt="Steam shadow" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/15-steam-shadow.jpg"></p>
<p>As well as a more traditional&nbsp;shadow:</p>
<p><img alt="Panoramic Shaddow" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/16-panoramic-shadow.jpg"></p>
<p>Long stretches of snowpack allowed for optimized routing and smooth&nbsp;sailing:</p>
<p><img alt="Snow passage" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/17-snow-passage.jpg"></p>
<p>I found the snow was most compact and responsive when off the beaten path. Post-holing ⁠— a term some hikers use for when their feet sink into the snow ⁠— was&nbsp;non-existent.</p>
<p>Based on the recommendation of a warden at the Hrafntinnusker hut, I ventured off the Laugavegur to a nearby ice cave that had collapsed, taking with it a German explorer — a tragic reminder of the drastic ephemerality of Iceland&#8217;s volcanic&nbsp;landscapes.</p>
<p>The trek from the hut to the ice cave was a nice opportunity to escape the crowds, practice my skiing (without skis), and catch some&nbsp;views:</p>
<p><img alt="View from the Hrafntinnusker ice cave" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/18-hrafntinnusker-ice-cave-view.jpg"></p>
<p>The only problem was that I didn&#8217;t see the ice cave ahead … until I turned around and&nbsp;witnessed:</p>
<p><img alt="Collapsed Ice cave at Hrafntinnusker" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/19-collapsed-ice-cave-hrafntinnusker.jpg"></p>
<p>Take a guess on what topographical features give rise to such a&nbsp;sight.</p>
<p>I continued on to Landmannalaugar. The early start that morning paid off as a prolonged rain began as I neared camp. If you are looking to combine the Laugavegur and Hellismannaleið trails, check out the route I took through the Laugahraun lava field to avoid duplicating trail. This section never ceased to&nbsp;amaze:</p>
<p><img alt="Laugahraun lava field bird" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/20-laugahraun-lava-field-bird.jpg"></p>
<p>At Landmannalaugar, I setup up my tent at the most protected site I could find, which the many other campers seemed to have&nbsp;overlooked:</p>
<p><img alt="Landmannalaugar tent setup" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/21-landmannalaugar-tent-setup.jpg"></p>
<p>I recuperated in the hot springs, enjoying the juxtaposition of cold rain and geothermal&nbsp;bath:</p>
<p><img alt="Landmannalaugar Hot Springs" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/22-landmannalaugar-hot-springs.jpg"></p>
<p>While not a problem for the day-tourists that arrive by the bus load, those who pass through Landmannalaugar on foot may want to avoid unnecessarily wetting their limited wardrobe. When I asked the women at the information office whether it was acceptable to enter the hot springs nude, she replied, &#8220;Of course, this is&nbsp;Iceland.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="hellismannalei-trail">Hellismannaleið&nbsp;Trail</h2>
<p>Feeling refreshed, sporting two pairs of surprisingly dry socks, I embarked on the Hellismannaleið trail to Rjúpnavellir. The morning started by crossing a stream-ridden valley before hiking out over the mountains in the&nbsp;distance:</p>
<p><img alt="Starting the Hellismannaleið" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/23-starting-hellismannaleid.jpg"></p>
<p>I successfully hopped over most of the streams … until I failed, soaking my shoes. At least I could just walk right through the remaining valley streams with my shoes on. Later I would discover a new trick for hopping streams: temporarily extending my trekking poles to max height and swinging over the&nbsp;crossing.</p>
<p>A bit later, nature gifted me with a bridge of&nbsp;sorts:</p>
<p><img alt="Natural bridge" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/24-natural-bridge.jpg"></p>
<p>Unlike the previous trails where hikers were plentiful, I would only see a single couple for the entirety of my time on the Hellismannaleið. Judge for yourself, but the beauty of this trail is distinct and unsurpassed by the Fimmvörðuháls and Laugavegur trails. Meanwhile, there were none of the sights that make Jake mad, like foam sleeping pads still in their plastic shrinkwrap and backpacks with rain covers on a sunny&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>A took a liking to a lost beanie that I picked up earlier in the&nbsp;hike:</p>
<p><img alt="Beanie" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/25-beanie.jpg"></p>
<p>Also notice the water bottle clip on my shoulder strap, which I was sporting for the first time. I became a big fan … once I performed substantial aftermarket modifications (i.e. superglue) to the velcro attachment&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>No complaining about a stream crossing when it&#8217;s this&nbsp;tranquil:</p>
<p><img alt="Stream crossing Hellismannaleið" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/26-stream-crossing-hellismannaleid.jpg"></p>
<p>The landscapes transitioned to&nbsp;desert:</p>
<p><img alt="Desert depression" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/27-desert-depression.jpg"></p>
<p>The wind was at my back, and I was covering more miles in a day than I ever had before. If the wind direction is consistent, this is a big benefit to the Landmannalaugar to Rjúpnavellir&nbsp;orientation.</p>
<p>Behold, Hekla, one of Iceland&#8217;s most active volcanoes, having last erupted in&nbsp;2000.</p>
<p><img alt="Hekla" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/28-hekla.jpg"></p>
<p>For the remainder of the hike, Hekla would remain as a frequent site. In many ways, Hellismannaleið and its extended versions are a homage to&nbsp;Hekla.</p>
<p>I arrived to Áfangagil, which had not yet opened for the season, but did have running water and an unlocked&nbsp;outhouse:</p>
<p><img alt="Áfangagil trail sign" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/29-afangagil-trail-sign.jpg"></p>
<p>The trail signs matched the style of trail markers on the Hellismannaleið: white-tipped posts in the&nbsp;ground.</p>
<p>The ground at Áfangagil was uneven, and only one tight spot seemed to offer wind&nbsp;protection:</p>
<p><img alt="Áfangagil tent site behind outhouse" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/30-afangagil-tent-site.jpg"></p>
<p>Sharp volcanic rock below made me wish I had brought my polycro groundsheet to protect my Dyneema Composite Fabric bathtub floor. In retrospect, I should have left the thinlight pad at home and brought the polycro&nbsp;instead. </p>
<p>The arid scenes of endless gravel changed abrutly, as a stream emerged from&nbsp;nowhere:</p>
<p><img alt="Stream from nowhere" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/31-stream-from-nowhere.jpg"></p>
<p>There were some electronic instruments, perhaps to measure siesmic activity? The stream provided a prolonged oasis, replete with plant life, fish, and&nbsp;waterfalls:</p>
<p><img alt="Waterfalls" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/32-waterfalls.jpg"></p>
<p>When I saw the endless fields of lupine (<em>Lupinus nootkatensis</em>), my world turned upside&nbsp;down:</p>
<p><img alt="lupine, Lupinus nootkatensis" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/33-lupine-lupinus-nootkatensis.jpg"></p>
<p>Purple as far as the eye could see. I would later learn lupine is non-native species to Iceland, with locals having <a href="https://www.hakaimagazine.com/features/why-iceland-is-turning-purple/">mixed opinions</a> about this foreign&nbsp;invader.</p>
<h2 id="hellismannalei-trail-extension">Hellismannaleið Trail&nbsp;Extension</h2>
<p>I arrived to Rjúpnavellir around 10:30 <span class="caps">AM</span>. The online <span class="caps">GPS</span> route I was using for the Hellismannaleið Trail ended here. My bus was scheduled to stop at Leirubakki, a bit down the road, at 7:30 <span class="caps">PM</span>. I was planning on either road walking or&nbsp;hitch-hiking.</p>
<p>But to my surprise, the trail signs indicated that I had not yet completed the Hellismannaleið&nbsp;Trail:</p>
<p><img alt="Rjúpnavellir sign shows trail continue" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/34-rjupnavellir-trail-continues.jpg"></p>
<p>The trail goes on! Another 25 kilometers to Leirubakki! So not only did I have some extra time on my hands, but the Hellismannaleið trail seemed to continue in a circuitous route to my pickup spot. I had to&nbsp;continue.</p>
<p>First, I grabbed a beer at Rjúpnavellir for under $2 <span class="caps">USD</span>. While Iceland is generally quite expensive, Rjúpnavellir was the exception. Another customer came to recharge his <span class="caps">RV</span> while napping… they charged him 500 <span class="caps">ISK</span>, which is the same price Básar charged me to briefly charge my external phone battery three days earlier. Wifi was free, and I began preloading the maps for the&nbsp;extension.</p>
<p>The staff was helpful. While the boss was aware of the trail to Leirubakki, he had only done the first section to a waterfall. However, he claimed that I was on the longest marked trail in Iceland, and I certainly did not want to stop&nbsp;short.</p>
<p>So I set off. It quickly became apparent that the footpath for the trail had become quite overgrown (if it ever existed at all). However, hundreds of white-tipped posts were dutifully spaced and placed to mark the trail. Nonetheless, I wouldn&#8217;t suggest embarking on this trail without <span class="caps">GPS</span>&nbsp;assistance.</p>
<p>Hiking at a hurried pace as to not miss the bus, I reached the&nbsp;waterfall:</p>
<p><img alt="dirty waterfall on Hellismannaleið Trail extension" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/35-waterfall-hellismannaleid-extension.jpg"></p>
<p>There was a long stretch of bushwacking through waist-high brush. Having learned of the lupine invasion, I trampled as many as possible (to little&nbsp;effect).</p>
<p>The trail eventually joined with a dirt road, which seemed to be frequented by horseback. The road passed by a quaint turf&nbsp;house.</p>
<p><img alt="turf house" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/36-turf-house.jpg"></p>
<p>Later the trail diverged from the dirt road. Here&#8217;s what the trail markers looked&nbsp;like:</p>
<p><img alt="trail marker" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/37-trail-marker.jpg"></p>
<p>The heavy infrastructure was generally in good shape, including a bridge and several ladders over&nbsp;fences:</p>
<p><img alt="ladder over fence" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/38-ladder-over-fence.jpg"></p>
<p>Much of the land, especially near the end, seemed to have been used for grazing somewhat recently. I left many&nbsp;footprints: </p>
<p><img alt="footprint" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/39-footprint.jpg"></p>
<p>But by time you arrive, my footprints will have blown away. Finally, I reached Leirubakki, the&nbsp;end:</p>
<p><img alt="selfie at real end" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/40-selfie-at-real-end.jpg"></p>
<p>Note the sign clearly indicates that the Hellismannaleið trail starts here. But since other resources show Rjúpnavellir as the terminus, I&#8217;ve decided to refer to this portion as the&nbsp;&#8220;extension&#8221;.</p>
<p>With still a bit more time until the bus arrived, I visited the Hekla Center located in Leirubakki. In case you were wondering what to do if Hekla erupts, I took a picture of one of the&nbsp;exhibits:</p>
<p><img alt="writing on the wall of the Hekla Visitor Center museum" src="https://blog.dhimmel.com/iceland/41-hekla-visitor-center-exhibit.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>
<p>Putting together my <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/pzft6">gear list</a> for this trip was a fun challenge. Before the hike, I gave a <a href="https://vimeo.com/344998904">professional presentation</a> in London. Therefore, my gear list contains a section of travel/business-related gear that I left at the <a href="https://www.reykjavikcampsite.is/">Reykjavík Campsite</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d advise hikers to be well prepared against the cold, wind, and rain. I hiked several days in shorts, but having lightweight leg and arm covering can help protect against flies (big buzzing flies, not mosquitos) and the sun. I always hike with <span class="caps">GPS</span> and maps on my phone, but this was especially improtant for the Hellismannaleið trail (&amp;&nbsp;extension).</p>
<p>My father often makes gear recommendations that deviate from the ultralight philosophy, such as wearing heavy hiking boots and bringing extra pairs of clothing. I disregarded this advice. He did however recommend one item I am glad I brought: the snow baskets for my trekking&nbsp;poles.</p>
<p>Since I was flying, with no checked bags, I made sure not to take anything that would be problematic for the airport scanners. The <strong>carbon fiber</strong> tent stakes and decomposable trekking poles passed through security four times. I used my <a href="https://www.traildesigns.com">Trail Designs</a> titanium wind screen with Esbit&nbsp;fuel.</p>
<p>Since I was flying through the <span class="caps">UK</span>, I couldn&#8217;t bring any food containing meat, dairy, or potatoes. I sure was sick of nuts by the end. Many of the huts did have hiker boxes, where I picked up some basic dehydrated&nbsp;meals.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t bring a headlight or water filter, based on Tómas&#8217; advice. However, a few water treatment tablets (repackaged into a plastic pen casing, of course) would have been nice for some water sources located downstream of grazing grounds or other fecal matter of unknown&nbsp;origin.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>What an amazing trek. If you&#8217;re seeking a longer hike than the usual Fimmvörðuháls and Laugavegur trails, consider adding on the Hellismannaleið. If you&#8217;re feeling adventurous and are of a completionary temperament go all the way to/from Leirubakki as opposed to&nbsp;Rjúpnavellir.</p>
<p>Iceland is an amazing natural resource. Help maintain it on the trail by picking up any litter. Hiking is a great way to enjoy Iceland while avoiding many of the more costly and thus environmentally destructive forms of&nbsp;tourism.</p>
<p>Iceland&#8217;s beauty comes with risk, so please make sure to prepare sufficiently. Plan for rugged conditions. I got lucky with the weather, so make sure you have backup plans should your pace be slower than expected. Note that most common itineraries for these trails take approximately double the days (i.e. 9 days as opposed to&nbsp;5).</p>
