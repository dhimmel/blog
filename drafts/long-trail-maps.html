      Mapping the Long Trail: the best is now free with&nbsp;OpenStreetMaps

<p>On January 24, 2010, Zeke Farwell completed the Long Trail.
He had begun just two days earlier, connecting more than 50 segments of trail spanning over 200 miles.
Motivated by &#8220;the longest and most well known hiking trail in Vermont&#8221;,
Zeke often revisited portions of the trails in the years to&nbsp;come.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not revealing a secret <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/route/long-trail-vt" title="Fastest Known Time for the Long Trail"><span class="caps">FKT</span></a>,
but rather the completion of the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/391736#map=8/43.888/-72.817">Long Trail route</a> on OpenStreetMap.
OpenStreetMap is like Wikipedia but for maps: a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>When I got in touch with Zeke, he wrote
&#8220;I started contributing to OpenStreetMap in 2008 largely because good online trail maps were hard to come by at the time.&#8221;
Due to the efforts of contributors like Zeke &#8212;- most volunteers, exceeding 6 million in number &#8212;-
OpenStreetMap has begun to rival, and often exceed, proprietary alternatives like Google Maps.
I write this post to announce that <strong>the best map of the Long Trail is now freely available to anyone via OpenStreetMap</strong>.
Curious where the oldest long-distance hiking trail in America wanders?
Look no further than <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-three">The Big&nbsp;Three</h2>
<p>My interest in mapping the Long Trail began with my September 2020 southbound thru-hike.
As far as navigation options for hikers go, there are three main mapmakers:
Green Mountain Club, Guthook, and&nbsp;OpenStreetMap.</p>
<h3 id="green-mountain-club">Green Mountain&nbsp;Club</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.greenmountainclub.org/">Green Mountain Club</a> (<span class="caps">GMC</span>) is the non-profit organization that maintains the Long Trail.
The <span class="caps">GMC</span> publishes a <a href="https://store.greenmountainclub.org/collections/gmc-publications/products/new-5th-edition-vermonts-long-trail-map-waterproof">paper Long Trail map</a>, last updated in 2015 and on its 5th edition.
The map is plastic-coated for water resistance and divided into 8 sections to minimize refolding.
It includes distances, major side trails, shelter locations, 100-feet contour lines, hill-shading, elevation profiles, and nearby towns at 1:85,000 scale.
If you like a physical map, then consider supporting the <span class="caps">GMC</span>!
The map is listed at $12.95, and available from major retailers like <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/177869/green-mountain-club-vermonts-long-trail-map-5th-edition"><span class="caps">REI</span></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Green-Vermonts-Long-Trail/dp/1888021462/">Amazon</a>, and your local&nbsp;outfitters.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">GMC</span> also releases a digital version of their map, <a href="https://www.avenzamaps.com/maps/908930/long-trail-map">available</a> via the Avenza mobile App for $12.99.
With this map, you are essentially buying a georeferenced <span class="caps">PDF</span> of the paper map.
This means you can use your phone&#8217;s <span class="caps">GPS</span> (which works in airplane mode) to superimpose your location on a static map.
But the PDFs are locked in the Avenza app, so make sure you like the Avenza interface before&nbsp;purchasing.</p>
<h3 id="guthook-guides">Guthook&nbsp;Guides</h3>
<p><a href="https://atlasguides.com/">Guthook Guides</a> brands itself &#8220;the #1 app for long-distance hikes&#8221;.
Currently, Guthook sells guides for 53 trails, including the <a href="https://atlasguides.com/long-trail/">Long Trail</a> for the price of $11.99.
The Guthook App includes the route and locations of shelters, campsites, water sources, and viewpoints.
The real selling point however is the large number of user comments on points of interest (POIs).
The comments can help with scouting to optimize your hike,
but also can distract from the experience,
burn a hole in your battery pack,
and create reliance on an information source that isn&#8217;t available for trails off the beaten&nbsp;path.</p>
<p>Guthook is made by hikers for hikers.
But its database of routes and POIs is proprietary.
Leaving a comment, or suggesting a new <span class="caps">POI</span>, on Guthook is sharing that information only with customers of Guthook,
rather than society at&nbsp;large.</p>

<h3 id="openstreetmap">OpenStreetMap</h3>
<p>Unlike the proprietary Google or Apple Maps,
anyone is free to reuse and modify OpenStreetMap.
This has resulted in a diverse range of <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8050232" title="Corporate Editors in the Evolving Landscape of OpenStreetMap">contributors</a> and <a href="https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/about-osm-community/consumers/">consumers</a>.
Tesla owners have added missing parking lots to improve their cars&#8217; <em>Smart Summon</em> autonomous parking feature.
Amazon <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Organised_Editing/Activities/Amazon#searchInput">updates</a> roadways and adds missing driveways to improve their delivery logistics.
The <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> applies the map to assist with disaster response. 
Popular navigation apps like Strava and MapMyRide show their users maps derived from OpenStreetMap.
I&#8217;ve even used it to <a href="https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/1221841589661659138">navigate</a> through&nbsp;Africa.</p>
<p>OpenStreetMap has a lot more than just <em>streets</em>,
and contains natural features as well as those related to outdoor recreation,
such as trails, campsites, shelters, waterways, and cliffs.
Unlike the <span class="caps">GMC</span> and Guthook maps, OpenStreetMap is not based around any single trail.
Nonetheless, it <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/391736#map=9/43.9839/-72.4919">contains</a> the entire Long&nbsp;Trail.</p>
<p>The website <a href="https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/#route?id=391736&amp;map=9!43.8387!-72.55740">Waymarked Trails</a> allows you download the trail as <span class="caps">GPX</span> or <span class="caps">KML</span>,
such that you could load it into your favorite navigation app &#8212;-
popular ones include

<h2 id="the-long-trail-from-openstreetmap">The Long Trail from&nbsp;OpenStreetMap</h2>
<p>The Long Trail is the world&#8217;s first long distance hiking trail and runs from Massachusetts to Canada along the spine of the Green Mountains in&nbsp;Vermont.</p>
<p>This route was posted as a companion to the blog post https://blog.dhimmel.com/long-trail-maps/. The route was extracted from OpenStreetMap on 2021-06-27 using Waymarked Trails:&nbsp;https://hiking.waymarkedtrails.org/#route?id=391736&amp;map=9!43.8387!-72.5574</p>
<h2 id="other">other</h2>
<p>that make up America&#8217;s oldest long-distance hiking trail as it wanders from Massachusetts to Canada along the spine of the Green Mountains in&nbsp;Vermont.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congrats on the thru-hike! I also hiked the <span class="caps">LT</span> in 2012. I’m having a hard time remembering exactly when I started working on the long trail in <span class="caps">OSM</span>, but I believe it was one of the earliest things I did. I started contributing to <span class="caps">OSM</span> in 2008 largely because good online trail maps were hard to come by at the time. I added trails in Vermont because that is where I live and like to hike. The Long Trail is the longest and most well known hiking trail in Vermont so it made sense to get that into <span class="caps">OSM</span>. I’m pretty sure I added it in my first year or two working on <span class="caps">OSM</span>. The ways making up the trail probably predate the relation because the idea of a relation data structure was either still very new to <span class="caps">OSM</span> or didn’t exist yet. If I remember correctly, I imported most of the trail from a publicly available government data source so it would have been “complete” from end to end right away. This imported trail was better than nothing, but not very accurate so for the next few years I refined it from my own <span class="caps">GPS</span> traces, aerial imagery, or any other data sources I came across. I haven’t payed too much attention in recent years, but I’m sure there are still plenty areas that need improvement. I did revisit the area around the Winooski River bridge after that was built and the trail rerouted in that&nbsp;area.</p>
