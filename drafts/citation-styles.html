      On author versus numeric citation&nbsp;styles
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">March 12, 2018</span>

    <p>Should citations in scholarly writing appear as author-year snippets, like (<a href="http://site.uit.no/english/writing-style/citationstyles/" title="Citation styles: Vancouver and Harvard systems">Pantcheva, 2018</a>; <a href="http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/1.0.1/primer.html" title="Primer — An Introduction to CSL: v1.0.1">Zelle, 2015</a>), or numbers, like [<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/studyingeffectively/writing/referencing/styles.aspx" title="Studying Effectively: Referencing styles. University of Nottingham">1</a>,<a href="https://library.wur.nl/infoboard/7_citing/citation_styles.html" title="Author-date or numeric style. Wageningen University &amp; Research">2</a>]?
Let&#8217;s refer to these two methods as <em>author-style</em> and <em>numeric-style</em>.
You may have also heard them referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthetical_referencing">Harvard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_system">Vancouver</a> referencing&nbsp;systems.</p>
<h2 id="author-style">Author-style</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of author-style from our recent Sci-Hub Coverage Study <a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32822" title="Sci-Hub provides access to nearly all scholarly literature. eLife. 2018">published</a> in <em>eLife</em>.
First, see how citations appear in the main&nbsp;text:</p>
<p><img alt="Sci-Hub Coverage Study in eLife: author-style citations" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/drafts/scihub-cites-author.png"></p>
<p>Notice how studies with 3 or more authors use &#8220;et al.&#8221; rather than listing every single author.
Also note how the letter <code>a</code> was appended to <code>Van Noorden, 2013</code> to denote that this is the first of the two Van Noorden articles from 2013 that we&nbsp;cited.</p>
<p>With author-style, references (items in the bibliography) are sorted alphabetically by first-author&#8217;s&nbsp;surname:</p>
<p><img alt="Sci-Hub Coverage Study in eLife: author-style refences" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/drafts/scihub-refs-author.png"></p>
<h2 id="numeric-style">Numeric-style</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the same paragraph as above, but using numeric-style, which is the default for Manubot – the tool we used to write <a href="https://greenelab.github.io/scihub-manuscript/">the manuscript</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Sci-Hub Coverage Study via Manubot: numeric-style citations" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/drafts/scihub-cites-numeric.png"></p>
<p>When using numeric-style citations, references are numbered according to the order they were cited.
As such, the references section (bibliography) is a numbered&nbsp;list:</p>
<p><img alt="Sci-Hub Coverage Study via Manubot: numeric-style references" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/drafts/scihub-refs-numeric.png"></p>
<h2 id="usage-in-pubmed-central">Usage in PubMed&nbsp;Central</h2>
<p>In general, each journal (or even publisher) has a preferred citation style that&#8217;s applied to all of their articles.
However, I couldn&#8217;t find much information on the overall prevalence of the two styles.
Hence, I turned to the PubMed Central (<span class="caps">PMC</span>) Open Access (<span class="caps">OA</span>) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/">Subset</a>, which as of March 4, 2018 contained fulltexts for 1,875,131 articles in a standardized machine-readable format (<span class="caps">JATS</span> <span class="caps">XML</span>).
This corpus is fantastic for text <span class="amp">&amp;</span> data mining.
Note it could be ever better, but due to licensing issues, 61% of the 4.8 million articles in <span class="caps">PMC</span> are excluded from its <span class="caps">OA</span> Subset:
please help by only publishing in <a href="https://goo.gl/S8uKk5" title="DOAJ Search for CC BY Journals">libre <span class="caps">OA</span></a>&nbsp;journals!</p>
<p>Anyways, 1,602,392 articles included citations and references (<a href="https://gitlab.com/dhimmel/pmc-citation-styles">source code</a>).
I crafted a <em>heuristic</em> (a bunch of rules / handmade algorithm) to classify the citation style of an article as numeric, author, or unknown.
While there&#8217;s no guarantee the algorithm correctly classifies every citation/article, I fed it a collection of <a href="https://gitlab.com/dhimmel/pmc-citation-styles/blob/afbcbe68479f54d2e77a2352340809e0fc1e9e56/utils/test_utils.py#L80-110">test cases</a> (enforced via <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/550143a" title="Collaborative software development made easy">continuous integration</a>) to ensure it&#8217;s not too&nbsp;misbehaved.</p>
<p>Overall, 86.0% of articles used numeric-style and 12.2% used author-style (the algorithm could not resolve 1.8% of articles, classifying them as unknown).
Here&#8217;s the popularity of each citation style by year of publication (absolute counts on the left, normalized proportions on the&nbsp;right):</p>
<p><img alt="Popularity of citation styles by year" src="https://glcdn.githack.com/dhimmel/pmc-citation-styles/raw/694ebea384372d87e68b4582087a10233de945b5/figure/years-mutlipanel.svg"></p>
<p>We see that each year more articles were added to the <span class="caps">PMC</span> <span class="caps">OA</span> Subset than the year before, with a total of 255,736 articles added from 2017.
However, the relative popularity of author- versus numeric-style citations has remained relatively&nbsp;constant.</p>
<p>What about the proliferation of unknown-style articles from 2008–2012?
These are almost all from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acta_Crystallographica"><em>Acta Crystallographica</em></a> series of journals, which hyperlinks citations using the ▶ symbol.
See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793688/" title="De Silva et al. 2013. Acta Crystallographica Section E: Structure Reports. DOI: 10.1107/S1600536813018643"><code>PMC3793688</code></a> for example.
Manual inspection reveals that <em>Acta Crystallographica</em> references are actually&nbsp;author-style.</p>
<p>Here are some easter&nbsp;eggs:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2003 and 2004, <em><span class="caps">PLOS</span> Biology</em> published 283 articles using author-style citations before switching to numeric-style, which remains the <span class="caps">PLOS</span> style to this&nbsp;day.</li>
<li>The article with the most references at 3,112 is <a href="https://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.59.6261">World checklist of hornworts and liverworts</a> in the journal <em>PhytoKeys</em> (<code>PMC4758082</code>), which used author-style for its 12,274 in-text&nbsp;citations.</li>
<li>The article with the second-most references at 2,857 is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-014-2981-5"><span class="caps">QCD</span> and strongly coupled gauge theories</a> from <em>The European Physical Journal C</em> (<code>PMC4413533</code>), which uses numeric-style to render its 3,679 in-text&nbsp;citations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-worst-case">The worst&nbsp;case</h2>
<p>Below, I&#8217;ll go over the pros and cons of author- versus numeric-style.
But first, I want to introduce the Project Rephetio manuscript that will help exhibit the <em>worst-case</em> performance of the two&nbsp;styles.</p>
<p>Project Rephetio was the final act of my PhD, and we took a <a href="http://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#realtime-open-science-thinklab">radically open</a> approach for this study.
First, we used the (now defunct) website Thinklab to post our proposal and publicly discuss the project while it was underway.
All code was posted immediately to GitHub under an open license.
Data was also uploaded to GitHub, or if too large, to Figshare.
In the end, the project encompassed 86 Thinklab discussions, 41 <a href="https://git.io/v5zvX">GitHub</a> repositories (23 of which we archived on <a href="https://goo.gl/FMiqHq">Zenodo</a>), 9 <a href="https://doi.org/ccq3">Figshare</a> records, and several prepublication manuscripts (i.e. via Manubot, Thinklab, and&nbsp;bioRxiv).</p>
<p>The Project Rephetio manuscript was <a href="http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26726">eventually published</a> in the journal <em>eLife</em> with a total of 394 citations to 241 references.
I was the first author of 93 of the references, which took a full three pages of bibliography in <a href="http://blog.dhimmel.com/drafts/elife-26726-v2.pdf"><em>eLife</em>&#8216;s <span class="caps">PDF</span></a> (<em>eLife</em> uses&nbsp;author-style):</p>
<p><img alt="Project Rephetio eLife PDF: all references to Himmelstein first-author works" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/drafts/elife-26726-v2-himmelstein-refs.png"></p>
<p>Only one of these &#8220;self-citations&#8221; was to a traditional scholarly output — the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004259" title="Himmelstein &amp; Baranzini. 2015. Heterogeneous Network Edge Prediction: A Data Integration Approach to Prioritize Disease-Associated Genes. PLOS Computational Biology">predecessor study</a> to Project Rephetio.
The remaining 92 references were to non-traditional outputs generated during the course of the study:
62 Thinklab discussions/documents, 24 Zenodo records, 5 Figshare records, and 1&nbsp;preprint.</p>
<p>As scientific communication grows beyond immutable journal articles in the coming decades, we can expect to see more and more studies like Project Rephetio, which will have a large number of references to non-journal outputs, such as code, data, and discussion forums.
Today&#8217;s worst-case bibliography will be tomorrow&#8217;s average&nbsp;case.</p>
<h2 id="which-style-is-best">Which style is&nbsp;best?</h2>
<p><strong>Which style do I prefer?
Numeric-style!</strong>
The worst-case performance of author-style is unacceptable.
The benefits of author-style are becoming less and less relevant to modern scholarship and publication&nbsp;media.</p>
<p>To demonstrate my point, let&#8217;s examine the pros of each style.
For this task, we&#8217;ll refer to a paragraph from Project Rephetio.
Here&#8217;s the paragraph in author-style, via <a href="https://lens.elifesciences.org/26726/"><em>eLife</em> Lens</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Project Rephetio via eLife Lens: author-style citations" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/drafts/rephetio-cites-author.png"></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the same paragraph in numeric-style via <a href="https://think-lab.github.io/p/rephetio/report/#edges">Thinklab</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Project Rephetio via Thinklab: numeric-style citations" src="http://blog.dhimmel.com/drafts/rephetio-cites-numeric.png"></p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-author-style">Advantages of&nbsp;author-style</h2>
<p>Author style has several&nbsp;benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>You can recognize the referenced work from just its in-text citation.</strong>
For example, you don&#8217;t need a reference section to know which study this sentence cites (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/171737a0">Watson <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Crick, 1953</a>).
<em>However</em>, science has grown.
No one has the mental capacity to remember every study in their field.
Nowadays, imagine you&#8217;re reading a genomics study and encounter a citation to <code>Li et al., 2017</code>.
Even if you&#8217;d memorized every genomics study in PubMed, you&#8217;d still be choosing between <a href="https://goo.gl/xUHY8i" title="Search PubMed for records published in 2017 with a first author of Li and a MeSH term of genomics">84 papers</a>.
Furthermore, the advantages of immediate recognizability are scant when hovering over a citation pops-up a tooltip with full reference information.
Also, there&#8217;s less room for misrecognition when readers are always shown the full author list, title, and journal information when investigating a&nbsp;citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The first author is more visibly credited.</strong>
Credit is important in science.
As a first author, it can certainly be nice to find your surname in the main text of articles that you&#8217;ve influenced.
Unfortunately, science is rarely a one-(wo)man job these days, with biomedical publications <a href="https://10.15200/winn.141832.26907" title="Robert Aboukhalil · 2014 · The rising trend in authorship · Winnower">now averaging</a> over five authors.
Precisely since credit is so important for propelling the academic enterprise forward, we should avoid systems that tend to improperly credit individuals over&nbsp;communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dates help readers establish the chronology of prior work and quickly identify outdated citations.</strong>
For example, the average R&amp;D cost of a new drug in the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> is $93 million (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199507020-00007" title="DiMasi, Hansen, Grabowski, Lasagna. Research and Development Costs for New Drugs by Therapeutic Category. PharmacoEconomics. 1995">DiMasi et al., 1995</a>).
However, numeric-style citations still allow readers to access dates, albeit with an extra step.
And when trying to reconstruct the chronology of a certain topic, I&#8217;ll often need to see the precise date in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"><span class="caps">ISO</span> 8601</a> format (e.g. <code>2018-03-12</code>), which is too verbose for in-text citations&nbsp;anyways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Citations and references can be prepared independently</strong>, without the assistance of a typesetting program.
Not having to renumber every reference when adding a citation to the beginning of a document is a big advantage if you&#8217;re typesetting manually.
However, there&#8217;s always the risk of author-year collisions, which either breaks the independence of citations and references or results in ambiguous&nbsp;citations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, the future of scholarly writing is cite-by-identifier.
For example, I&#8217;d cite Project Rephetio by its Digital Object Identifier like <code>[@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726]</code>.
Then, typesetting software, such as <a href="https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock">Manubot</a>, retrieves the corresponding bibliographic metadata and automatically formats both the citations and references according to <a href="https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles">whatever style</a> you&nbsp;specify.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-numeric-style">Advantages of&nbsp;numeric-style</h2>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the advantages of author&nbsp;style:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Numeric-style is more space efficient.</strong>
The 394 author-style citations from Project Rephetio consumed a total of 8,542 characters (excluding the surrounding parentheses and multi-citation separators).
That&#8217;s an average of 21.7 characters per citation versus 2.6 for numeric-style.
Author-style citations required 8 times as many characters than&nbsp;numeric-style!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Numeric-style is less distracting.</strong>
Author-style citations can be visually distracting because they introduce large gaps into the flow of the prose.
To avoid this disruption, author-style encourages grouping citations rather than interspersing them throughout a sentence.
It also discourages citing a large number of works.
The number and position of citations in scholarly writing should not be constrained by what is essentially a user-interface&nbsp;limitation!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Numeric lookup of references is easiest.</strong>
For both humans and machines, it&#8217;s easier to navigate a numbered list compared to an alphabetical one.
This is especially true when the alphabetical list has multiple references from the same first author.
If you disagree, I challenge you to pick a Himmelstein citation from the snippet above and try to find it in the alphabetical reference compilation.
Also notice the <code>Himmelstein et al.</code> references get all the way to <code>2015z</code>… I wonder if <code>2015aa</code> would have been&nbsp;next?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Numeric-style citations do not degrade when citing works without first authors.</strong>
Sometimes references don&#8217;t have authors.
Or the author is an organization or consortium. 
Author-style references can get quite unwieldy in these circumstances.
For example, check out this dataset citation as per <a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.705"><em>PeerJ</em></a>&#8216;s author-style, which consumes 71&nbsp;characters:</p>
</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="treatise">Treatise</h2>
<p>In certain types of writing, author-style citations do make sense.
For example, if you&#8217;re emailing a colleague or writing a GitHub issue comment, author-style citations (hyperlinked to the work, of course) are quick and easy.
However, in today&#8217;s scholarly environment, numeric-style is preferable for substantial manuscripts, where several failure modes of author-style citations are beginning to&nbsp;appear.</p>
